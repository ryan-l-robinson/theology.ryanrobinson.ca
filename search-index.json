The perfect love of Jesus casts out that stuff. We have new life in Jesus. We face no condemnation. That is all true and very important to remember.\n\nI talk about that kind of thing a lot, but sometimes we over-correct and become afraid of confession. One phrase I've heard is that we are Easter people, not Good Friday people. Yes, that's true. That is where our hope is found. But by definition Easter could not have happened without Good Friday. Jesus couldn't have been resurrected if he didn't die first. We, like Jesus, have new life, but the process of that new life isn't comfortable. It would be wrong to celebrate Easter without Good Friday just as it would be wrong to celebrate Good Friday without Easter.\n\n## The Practice of Confession\n\nConfession is an element of faith which has been scrubbed from Protestant tradition. There are good historical reasons. Confession was limited to being said to priests within the Catholic tradition and those priests were often corrupt at the time, helping out the Church institution and themselves rather than trying to help you and those you've hurt heal. The Protestant solution was effectively to wipe out any form of confession at all. The individualism that developed in the West made it much worse as our default is to hide anything from the community while (optimistically) trying to solve it all by yourself.\n\nI think **it's healthier to replace bad confession with good confession** instead of with no confession.\n\nThis isn't about speaking to a priest. As with Protestants, I affirm that all believers are members of the priesthood. We can all connect to God in confession.\n\nIt is about being vulnerable and acknowledging where we don't have our shit together. Because we don't. For some, maybe it seems like something minor while for others it seems like your life is falling apart and it is all your fault. But none of us do. We all have things we would benefit from being honest about.\n\n## Confession and Suffering\n\nTo put it another way, **how much of our own suffering and the suffering of others could we avoid or at least lessen if we lived a more humble and vulnerable life**?\n\nI think of stories of abusive pastors. Many admit to feeling alone, isolated, put up on a pedestal from everyone else. They don't risk breaking that image so they are not open about their own failings, even when it comes to serious harm done. We get cover-ups that cause more harm instead of honestly confessing, asking the harmed how they can be better, and then actually going and doing better (it may very well include having nothing to do with that congregation again).\n\nI think similarly of abusive husbands, or misogyny in general. Many are fuelled to some degree by cultural ideas of masculinity that tell men we are not allowed to be vulnerable or feel things. We have to be strong and in control. What if we opted instead to fight against that messaging? Instead of doing whatever it takes to get our wives in line, we could share where we are struggling, allowing them to build us up as we build them up.\n\nI think of racial tensions. Across the United States, many cities have been shut down for brief stretches by protesters. We had a similar smaller-scale day recently called #ShutDownCanada with protests in many cities about the systemic racism we perpetuate against our Indigenous peoples. What's remarkable to me is when I see wealthy white people complain they'll be 10 minutes late for work because of the disruption. Would we even have experienced that minor inconvenience - some will falsely call it suffering - if we truly repented of the far-worse suffering we have been a part of forcing on them? No! They wouldn't have a reason to be protesting!\n\nWe like to think the world operates on a zero sum game. Maybe in some ways it does, but not in the big picture. What makes the world better is picking up our crosses for others. We can't do that if we're focused on denying any fallibility in our lives because picking up our cross is an inherently vulnerable act - vulnerable enough to get us killed, in the case of Jesus and many others. We don't dwell in our past or present sins - we are defined by our forgiveness from them - but we cannot afford to ignore them or we will simply repeat them.\n\nThis Lent, I invite you to confess, to God, to spiritual leaders, and to others in the priesthood of all believers. Not because it is a rule required for God to love us but because we need it for our own health and the health of those who we impact with our lives.\n\nKyrie Elieson, Lord have mercy.\n","date":"2015-02-20T21:46:00.000Z"},"/2015/review-searching-for-sunday/":{"id":"/2015/review-searching-for-sunday/","title":"Review: Searching for Sunday","description":"Search for Sunday has many profound insights, even if its format is a bit of a stretch.","tags":"posts Books Church","content":"\n![Searching for Sunday](./Searching-Sunday-Cover.jpg)*Searching for Sunday* is Rachel Held Evans' best book yet. The main reason for that is because it is full of hope. *A Year of Biblical Womanhood* was a fantastic analysis of various biblical texts along with a fun engagement of how many different ways genuine Christians (and Jews) interpret those texts. *Faith Unraveled* (previously _Evolving in Monkey Town_) was very easy for so many to relate to, discussing her departure from conservative Evangelicalism into a world with a lot more questions. Those are definitely valuable, but they are by far the most valuable when those steps in the journey bring you to something more like *Searching for Sunday*. It's a mature faith that has wrestled through many questions and reached answers with a sense of humility intact.\n\nSince I've already spent time responding to each section, I'll just give some short notes of other positives and negatives about the book to wrap this up.\n\n## Positives\n\nThe writing style is beautiful, as usual for Rachel's books. When I first read one of her books (Biblical Womanhood), I sort of expected it to read like an extended blog post, but was surprised at the depth of the language used. This book is much less intellectual but is far deeper with her language.\n\nI love the honesty with failure - her own and others - without dwelling in shame of it. We need confession as it helps guide us to something better, which is exactly what Rachel does. Many other speakers and writers would either settle for wallowing in shame or brushing off any hint of problems in life. People are broken image bearers of God - we can acknowledge when brokenness comes out to try to fix it, but remember who we are at the core.\n\nOn a related note, she is incredibly gracious toward her \"enemies.\" I think of how she describes her old church: a group of loving people who she just couldn't agree with on many things anymore. I have a hard time thinking of hard complementarians as \"loving people\" and just boil it down to a disagreement, although I do think some forms of complementarianism can be free of direct harm. When people question my salvation because I believe God used evolution in creating the world, I generally don't rush to assume the best of them. Rachel does that very well.\n\nI love the glimpses we get into Rachel and Dan's relationship. The way they worked through so many things together is amazing. It's not a book about marriage, other than the last section, but their healthy marriage does stand out.\n\n## Negative\n\nMy biggest negative of the book I think is the structuring around the 7 sacraments. For some sections, the themes she discussed were really obvious and that made the imagery powerful; baptism and communion stand out as two particularly powerful sections to me. Others felt more like she was stretching, like confirmation. There may have still been more gained with this structure than lost, but it did stand out as a distraction sometimes when I was trying to draw the connection all through the section instead of maybe focusing as much on what she was actually saying.\n","date":"2015-04-24T10:30:00.000Z"},"/2015/review-christian-hope-through-fulfilled-prophecy/":{"id":"/2015/review-christian-hope-through-fulfilled-prophecy/","title":"Review: Christian Hope Through Fulfilled Prophecy","description":"I liked some things about this preterist reading of prophecy, but also had some disagreements.","tags":"posts Books Bible","content":"\n![Christian Hope through Fulfilled Prophecy cover](./ChristianHopeThroughFulfilledProphecyCover.jpg)\n\nI'm going to front load my central thought about *Christian Hope Through Fulfilled Prophecy*: it is not primarily a book about eschatology; it is primarily an apologetics argument. It is all about making sure that Jesus, and other biblical authors, were not wrong when they made claims of imminency for things like the parousia and the end of the age. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, and the author is clear about that purpose, but based on the title you might be coming in looking for something else.\n\n## The Argument\n\nTo summarize author Charles Meek's full preterist view as succinctly as I can:\n\n- \"The end of the age\" and similar language we usually assume means the ends of all physical existence was referring to the end of the Old Covenant age that came about with the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 C.E.\n- The second coming of Jesus, the parousia, also happened at 70 C.E.\n- Salvation was not complete until 70 C.E. I got a bit lost on why destroying the Temple was necessary on top of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.\n- People of faith before 70 C.E. were resurrected to Heaven in 70 C.E., having been asleep since their death.\n- People who die after 70 C.E. go immediately to be judged upon death.\n- We have been in the New Earth since 70 C.E. and it will never end, instead offering a perpetual supply of people who can populate Heaven upon making decisions of faith.\n\n## What I Liked\n\nMeek regularly made a point of calling out evangelicals who say they only believe what the Bible says but have fantastical eschatologies and no idea how to answer imminency texts.\n\nHe took the biblical text seriously.\n\nHe tackled complex ideas in words that intelligent lay people could understand.\n\nIt's a good reminder that the old covenant age is over.\n\nIt's a good reminder that the Bible was written _for_ everyone, but not _to_ everyone. Context matters in interpretation.\n\nThe description of dispensationalism near the end was very helpful.\n\nIt is internally consistent, as far as I could tell without really looking up every passage.\n\n## Differing Assumptions\n\nOn to the meat of the discussion, most of which are different assumptions between us rather than total holes in the argument:\n\nOne assumption Meek needed to make for this to all work is for every book of the Bible with an imminency text to have been written before 70 C.E. Otherwise, when the authors said the end of the age was coming soon, they were still wrong. With the purpose of the book being to prove the inerrancy of these prophecies, the whole book's argument would implode without that assumption. He doesn't really spend long trying to defend why every book was written before 70 C.E. except to say that some scholars think they were. Lots of other scholars disagree, though, at least for some texts.\n\nAnother differing assumption is our reading of Revelation. To me, Revelation is an apocalyptic demonstration of how Jesus defeats evil through his nonviolent sacrifice. While I found Meek's argument convincing that it was written during the persecution (Tribulation) of Nero rather than Domitian - those are the two main options that scholars narrow it down to - he casually dismissed any spiritualist readings to only talk about literal history, past or present, as the purpose. I would tend to believe that Revelation was speaking to a particular tribulation but is encouragement that Jesus' followers can apply to any tribulation because we know Jesus has triumphed over evil. Meek's system did not do an adequate job explaining how evil can still exist - he was very insistent that Jesus' victory was complete and Satan was vanquished, so all evil must be human free will. It transplanted Revelation's usefulness and hope from today into the past, and came across very privileged to dismiss evil so easily.\n\nMeek is a cessationist, using the argument that the charismatic gifts existed during the overlapping period of old and new covenants. Once the old was defeated along with Satan, the gifts were no longer necessary. I don't know why they would no longer be necessary, since it seems like the gifts would be more directly tied to the new than the old. There didn't seem to be any active role for the Holy Spirit for Christians today.\n\nIn some areas, like his distinction between the New Heaven and New Earth, Meek was definitely more dualist than I would be. Earth matters to Meek because that's where we make decisions whether to accept Jesus or not, but it and our bodies are really just a stepping stone to get to Heaven.\n\nMy biggest problem was with tying the parousia to the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple. For Meek, Jesus' role in coming again was destruction, not offering restoration in any way. Meek didn't dismiss that Jesus offered redemption, but that was all in the first coming. Logically consistent, maybe, but it doesn't sit right with me that Jesus would be that different than the first time. If anything, it fits my understanding of Jesus much better to see Pentecost as the parousia - restoring humanity and being with us always - but that was before most of the imminency texts so it wouldn't solve the apologetics problem.\n\nIn short, as with many theological questions, it really boils down to \"what is God like?\" I picture God first through the life of Jesus, then the rest of Scripture through that lens. I conclude that the struggle against evil is one that Jesus invites us all into. I conclude that God's judgement is about restoring rather than destroying. I conclude that God cares about this Earth, more than just a stepping stone. I just can't make the God I see in Jesus fit a few elements of this system which Meek lays out.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe title was _Christian Hope Through Fulfilled Prophecy_. Most of why this gives us hope, though, is because Jesus (and others) were right when they used imminency language. Meek's hope is in the truth of inerrant prophecy, while I feel more comfortable saying my hope is in Jesus regardless of what imminency texts meant. Other than that, I'm not convinced Meek's full preterism is any more hopeful.\n\n_Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the author and/or publisher through the Speakeasy blogging book review network.

I don't recall ever seeing A.D. used in the following 6 years of academia, plus an audited course after that, except maybe in some classic texts written at least a decade earlier. Many of them were classes that did talk extensively about events in time periods where the clarification is necessary - the biblical time period, essentially. Some of those years of academia were in seminary after all. Most if not all books I've read since then have similarly used C.E. and B.C.E. In fact, I'm pretty certain that seminary - and probably undergrad before it - explicitly specified in style guides for writing that we were to use C.E. and B.C.E.\n\nWhy the shift? In short, I think A.D. carries some problematic colonialist overtones to it. A.D. stands for Anno Domini, Latin for the year of our Lord. It does not stand for \"After Death\" as many English-speakers assume - I know I did for years as a kid. To put it simply, how would it feel if every time you referred to something in history, you had to refer to it as the year of our Lord, when you don't believe that Jesus is your Lord? That is a constant reminder that your beliefs are in a position of cultural inferiority to Christendom.\n\nIn fact, the only real argument I've heard made in favour of A.D. - other than \"we don't like change\" which I don't really count - is that it is a reminder of Christian influence on the world. For many Christians, that's an encouraging positive influence, at least as long as you overlook many of the abuses of power that went with it. For many others, that's not nearly as encouraging and could be a very harmful trigger if they already have negative experiences with Christian dominance.\n\nAs an Anabaptist, I believe that every person must make their own decision whether to follow Jesus or not. We cannot force people at the point of the sword or a gun to be a Christian. Using A.D., to me, is more subtle but carries a similar strategy. It tries to force the whole world to speak in Christian language. It tries to hang on to saying \"this is a Christian society!\" Regardless of the fact that many in our world are not Christians and that claim is simply not accurate, I also don't think this is a healthy attitude for Christians to take. We shouldn't force anybody to be Christian or even pretend to be Christian by using Christian language. I don't think that's how Jesus would operate. He invites people into a beautiful Kingdom of love and grace. He does not coerce them into being part of Christian domination.\n\nIf a simple change in our language is a way to not antagonize our neighbours, why wouldn't we do that simple act of love? Common Era (and Before Common Era) is the new standard in many circles. Yes, we're still setting dates around the life of Jesus - that would be impractical to try to reset to a different starting point - but we're no longer forcing a statement of religious affiliation every time somebody wants to talk about what year it is.\n","date":"2015-09-18T10:30:00.000Z"},"/2015/approaching-apologetics/":{"id":"/2015/approaching-apologetics/","title":"Approaching Apologetics","description":"Apologetics shouldn't be about convincing people you're right.","tags":"posts","content":"\nIn my later teen and early young adult years, apologetics were a fairly important discipline to me. I read all of Lee Strobel's \"Case For...\" books. Looking back on them, there were some ok ideas that I'm glad I picked up in an accessible way there instead of in a philosophy class. There were also a lot of things that I soon realized were really bad arguments, such as the treatment of evolution as obviously contrary to true Christianity as well as a lot of thoroughly-debunked arguments against evolution. I have an easier solution to that one: why couldn't God create the world and move it to where we are today through an evolutionary process?\n\n## Arguing Into the Kingdom?\n\nAt the time, the purpose for apologetics was essentially to be able to argue people into the Kingdom. I learned that this never works, and also doesn't seem at all in line with the way of Jesus. Discussing issues with somebody may be helpful and I'll get to that, but if you approach a discussion with the attitude that you need to convince inferior intellects of why you are right, you are never going to convince them you are right. People don't respond well to being treated as inferior. They get defensive and usually end up further entrenched in their prior beliefs.\n\nJared Byas recently talked about this on Pete Enns' blog (that post no longer exists for me to share it). He points out that when we present Christianity as the obvious common sense truth, that only leaves two options for people who don't agree: are they ignorant or are they evil? Either they just don't know better, so you really should inform them of how they are so unaware of the obvious realities of the world, or they are evil and are outright rejecting obvious common sense because they don't like implications on their lives. Insert stereotypes of atheists \"living in sin\" here: premarital sex, abortion, drugs, rock and roll, whatever.\n\nThe world is not that simple. There are good arguments for atheism. There are good arguments for any religion you choose. Yeah, I probably think there's enough good arguments for Christianity for it to win out for me on a purely intellectual contest, but that's not really the point.\n\n## The Foolishness of Christianity\n\nI find Christianity to be the most compelling worldview, but that's not even the same thing as being the most logical. **A big part of what I find so compelling about Christianity is that it isn't logical**. I'm not talking about historical facts or trusting the Bible or anything like that which usually dominate apologetics discussions. I'm talking about some of the bigger truths about how God works in the world.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nI believe that love wins over hatred. That's not logical. We can all think of examples where hatred seems to win, seriously harming those around us, and we feel like we must resort to hatred ourselves in order to fight back. But Christianity says not to repay evil for evil but to overcome evil with good.\n\nI believe that hope wins over fear. That's not logical. We have natural instincts to be afraid of a lot of things. It's necessary for survival, when we're talking about things like the instinct to avoid that tiger staring at us and licking its lips in the wild. Hope isn't usually a common sense default. And yet I hope for the better world that Jesus invites us to be a part of right now.\n\nI believe that grace wins over judgement. That's not logical. \"Common sense\" says that some people are bad and others are good, and we (the good guys) must punish them (the bad guys). And yet I follow Jesus in seeking to give grace to everybody because I still believe that while all of us do good and bad things, we all are still infinitely loved.\n\nI believe that life conquers death. That's not logical. We know that everybody dies and we have no verifiable idea of what happens after. And yet I believe that Jesus rose from the dead, the first fruits of all of creation's redemption.\n\nChristianity isn't primarily a logical faith. There's actually quite a bit foolish about it.\n\n## So What About Apologetics?\n\nI don't want to completely scrap a place for apologetics. Christianity isn't primarily a propositional faith, but we are still somewhat logical creatures. The best analogy I have heard is that of running a race with hurdles, where apologetics is removing the hurdles. We can help remove the intellectual roadblocks that are making it a lot harder or sometimes impossible to run the race.\n\nBut we can't run the race for them. There still has to be something at the other end of that track which compels them to walk or run toward it. That's Jesus and the kind of illogical things that I talked about above. Our first priority then, as it is in every other area of life, is to first reflect Jesus to the world. Help them see Jesus and be drawn to love, hope, grace, and life. Then within that relationship of helping them move toward that Jesus, help them wrestle with any hurdles that are in their way - really wrestle, where you might learn something too.\n\nApologetics don't have to be about convincing people why they are ignorant and should just agree with you already. It can, however, be an act of love. I'd like to see apologetics redeemed.\n","date":"2015-11-04T21:46:00.000Z"},"/2015/game-of-thrones-season-5/":{"id":"/2015/game-of-thrones-season-5/","title":"Game of Thrones Season 5","description":"Game of Thrones season 5 had some good things to say about the status quo, breaking down walls, and the dangers of merging church and state.","tags":"posts Movies and TV Church Politics","content":"\nI recently caught up on this past season (5) of _Game of Thrones_. There were a few big themes I did enjoy that made this the most interesting season to me so far. Spoilers will follow.\n\n## Protect the Status Quo?\n\nMy favourite line of the season, and the show in general so far, came from Tyrion Lannister. This may be a slight paraphrase:\n\n> It's easy to confuse what is with what ought to be, especially when what is works out in your favour.\n\nThat statement can be applied to a lot of issues in real life. When you are in a position of privilege, it is pretty common to assume that the ways things are is the way they should be. In this context, Daenerys has become Queen of Meereen. Her story to get there included freeing thousands of slaves. This season is focused on the backlash from those who previously owned slaves. After a few smaller cases of this violent backlash, one of these former-owners who is more sympathetic suggests she reinstate the fighting pits - using only free men this time - as a concession to the traditions. She initially resists and there is more violence, before ultimately giving in but it is too little too late.\n\nI have some sympathy for saying that sometimes we need to take changes slowly. And Daenyers definitely enacted a lot of dramatic changes very quickly. She's got the right vision. Now that Tyrion has joined her, I hope to see that optimistic progression to a better world taken at a realistic and sustainable pace.\n\n## The Cost of Breaking Down Walls\n\nAnother main thread in the season deals with Jon Snow and others at the Wall. The wildlings have been stopped, thanks to the help of Stannis at the end of the last season, but the White Walkers - much more dangerous - are still coming. Jon realizes that he needs the remaining wildlings on his side to stand a chance. Near the end of the season, he meets with some of their leaders and most agree to come, although the Walkers attack as the boats are being loaded so many do not make it out. Those who do make it are given unused land behind the wall, under the condition that they help fight when the Walkers arrive. It's a pretty good deal for all involved.\n\nBut there's a problem. The wildlings are the long-time enemy of the Night's Watch who guard the wall. Many of these people, who theoretically follow Jon, hate them. Their whole life has been devoted to stopping them from getting past the wall. Many of them lost family and friends to wildlings. Now their Commander just let them through and they're supposed to be allies.\n\nSo, even though it's a good deal from a logical perspective, several of his own men kill him in the final scene of the season. Or at least it looks like they do. Lots of Internet discussions are convinced he's not really dead or is but will be brought back to life. If the latter, that's a strong Jesus parallel: betrayed by his own people because he was too generous with those who are different but brought back to life.\n\n## Church and State Cooperation\n\nThere are two more storylines that both touch on the interaction of religion with the state. In the camp of Stannis, his adviser finally convinces him to sacrifice his daughter - burned alive while we hear her scream - to buy favour with the Lord of Light (a rare monotheistic religion for the GoT world). The daughter's mother hangs herself the next morning, half the army deserts him, and the adviser leaves before the battle where this sacrifice was supposed to guarantee him a win. He loses the battle and presumably his life (it isn't directly shown). If he had just attacked with his full army, he probably had a good chance. It's an interesting story of a political/military ruler trying to buy power through religion and it backfiring spectacularly.\n\nThe same theme runs longer throughout the narrative in King's Landing. Cersei, now Queen Mother as her son is married, gets stuck in a power struggle with the new Queen attempting to influence the weak-willed King. To gain an edge, she imprisons the current High Septon (the highest in the religion of the 7 gods) for taking advantage of his position to get rich, enjoy prostitutes, and so on. She puts in a very strict and simple leader instead, then gives him free reign to use force cracking down on immorality within the city. This includes the brother of the Queen who is gay, and then the Queen who defends him by lying under oath.\n\nUnfortunately for Cersei, it also backfires for her. She is arrested for her various crimes such as perjury, incest. After this time in a dark cell by herself, after being used to the life of nobility, she does confess - to as much as she needs to in order to get out, which was less than we the viewers know she has done. The followers of the High Septon clean her up, cut her hair short, and then parade her naked through the city as she walks back to the castle. While she walks forward, one of the female followers of the High Septon repeatedly ring a bell and call out the single word \"SHAME!\" After a few minutes, the civilians catch on - it's interesting that they don't seem to think of the idea themselves - and start yelling at her, throwing food and feces, and jumping out in front of her naked. She ultimately makes it to the castle where she collapses crying. It will be interesting to see how next season progresses; she's back in her seat of power, but has lost most of her influence.\n","date":"2015-11-19T21:46:00.000Z"},"/2015/the-rise-of-the-empire/":{"id":"/2015/the-rise-of-the-empire/","title":"The Rise of the Empire","description":"The Star Wars prequels had some good things to say about how authoritarians gain control.","tags":"posts Movies and TV Politics","content":"\nI haven't seen _The Force Awakens_ yet. I'll get there soon. In the meantime, I decided to rewatch the first six. I will defend III as a respectable movie other than some terrible writing for Anakin and Padme. I won't defend I and II at all except for one area of the plot that does always interest me: the rise of the Empire.\n\nPrior to the events that open the first movie, the Galactic Republic had been in relative peace for a long time. Of course there's still violence on the individual level up to the planetary level, but there's no large-scale warfare like that which characterizes the six movies.\n\nThe Republic didn't even have an army. They had the Jedi, who are probably best compared to the best-case scenario of police. They do not use force unless absolutely necessary. They don't enforce laws which aren't hurting anybody, but they do step in - including with some calculated violence if necessary - to help alleviate conflicts. I'm definitely not pretending they were pacifists, but they would probably mostly align with the goals of Just War theory. That was it for state violence, probably about as close to a utopia as possible.\n\nEnter Palpatine. He's an important Senator. He has a lot of significant say on the future of the galaxy. But that's not enough for him. He wants to rule the galaxy unilaterally. He's also a Sith Lord, so evil, but without ever really explaining what is evil about the dark side of the force in general or the Sith in particular (because they're motivated by anger?). Palpatine is the architect of everything that happens. Take any conspiracy theory you can imagine about the Illuminati secretly running the world, and amplify that to only one man over the entire galaxy.\n\n## Episode I\n\nEpisode I opens with the Trade Federation blockade, perfectly legal, but Palpatine is pulling the strings from behind and convinces them they need to start a war. **War tends to benefit those in power.** They aren't the ones actually dying in war. At best, they're using other lives as pawns to help people like them. At worst, they're using other lives as pawns to give themselves more power.\n\nThe current Chancellor doesn't act immediately (like in most democracies), and Palpatine gets Padme to call for a non-confidence vote which then puts him in power instead. This is a major theme: **he capitalizes on fears not to actually help those who are afraid but to help himself**. Padme ends up turning to the one who manufactured her sense of insecurity, hoping that he will answer that fear.\n\nThat sounds a lot like many of our current politicians: \"only I can solve the Muslim threat!\" It doesn't matter that the threat doesn't really exist (and it's a lot more likely to if we keep demonizing them). It would be a mistake to turn to our own Palpatines stoking fear. It makes us less safe while they benefit.\n\n## Episode II\n\nStarting Episode II, the war is in full effect. **What's the next big step for enforcing your power? Having an army.** The Jedi won't do - their Code stops them from blindly following Republic orders and their ability with the Force means they'll catch on eventually. Years in advance, Palpatine had his army being developed. They're clones, not regular recruits. They're genetically engineered to not only be a strong physical specimen, but also to be totally obedient.\n\nIn the real world, we don't (yet) have clones. Our armies do try to take as much individuality out of our soldiers as we can, though. Many would point out our militaries have characteristics similar to a cult: absolute obedience and internal justice. Plus, with modern technology, we can replace a lot of humans and their pesky consciences with blindly obedient technological warfare instead. Drones can bomb weddings and hospitals for us. If anybody notices, we'll just pretend it was a malfunction. Oops, accidentally killed 1000 civilians again.\n\n## Episode III\n\nOpening Episode III, the Republic is clearly winning the war thanks to the new army, but they still need to wipe out the opposing leadership. In the meantime, we learn that Palpatine has steadily been given more and more emergency powers. Hitler followed a tact like this - all of his power was democratically granted - and there are some disturbing trends again in current political discourse along the same lines.\n\nThe Jedi catch on and are prepared to force him to give up those powers as soon as the war is over, but it's too little, too late for a couple of reasons.\n\nThe obvious one in the movie is that Palpatine has converted Anakin. An interesting hypothetical is whether Anakin created a self-fulfilling prophecy. He saw that Padme would die in childbirth. She did, but it was because of the \"broken heart\" caused by Anakin (not going to pretend that makes sense). So, if he hadn't given in to his fear, would she have even died? **His own fear created the exact thing he was afraid of.**\n\nThe other factor is that Palpatine already controls basically the whole Senate. As Padme notes, democracy dies to the sounds of applause of the Senators who voted it away. Maybe they were under Palpatine's Force influence to a degree, but it never suggests that. It seems to be primarily that they were simply afraid and turned to somebody who promised to make it better.\n\n## Episodes IV-VI\n\nThat explains why the Empire is marked by its human-supremacy. To maintain power, they cannot allow other voices to be seen as equal. Only those with power get to speak. And then when their clones are all used up, they can recruit more because there are always people who want to wield power. They're not afraid to do things like slaughter Jawas or blow up an entire planet just to prove that they can, when it means they stay on top of the universe.\n\nThe real world parallel here is white supremacy, but you can also apply to patriarchy or any other group wielding power to maintain power at the expense of those who are different. This is how we know the Empire is evil as we watch the movies. And yet, it's easy for us to act more like the stormtroopers, maintaining the status quo that helps us no matter how much we trample on others to do it.\n\nBut there is, as Episode IV's title implies, a new hope. Hope always beats out the fear which the Empire is built upon, whether that Empire is Galactic, Roman, or American.\n","date":"2015-12-18T21:46:00.000Z"},"/2015/bringing-balance-to-the-force/":{"id":"/2015/bringing-balance-to-the-force/","title":"Bringing Balance to the Force","description":"The Jedi foolishly assumed a prophecy was all good news for them. We also mistakenly assume things are always about us.","tags":"posts Movies and TV Bible","content":"\nA Facebook conversation with a fellow Star Wars nerd reminded me of one of my annoyances in the prequels. If you've seen the movies, you probably remember the prophecy that somebody - who turned out to be Anakin - would bring balance to the Force. That's it that we ever hear about the prophecy itself. One thing I never got is why the Jedi would assume that \"bringing balance to the Force\" meant anything good for them. They, practitioners of the light side of the Force, have been in power for millenia. Wouldn't it be logical that balance would mean the light finally losing its power to the dark? I've never been able to think about what else it could possibly mean. We left the conversation by essentially saying that the Jedi probably didn't have any idea what the prophecy meant, and yet they assumed repeatedly that it would be great for them.\n\n## Reading the Bible\n\nThat gets me to a key point that applies to biblical interpretation and faith in general: we, those in power, tend to assume that everything in the galaxy is working to help us out in particular. It's not about helping those other people. They aren't really that important. We can simplify to say that we're selfish, but there's a lot of systemic sin that factors in so that we don't even realize we're being selfish most of the time. We just assume our perpetual supremacy, just like the Jedi did.\n\nThe truth is that **the Bible is a remarkable piece of literature in that it is almost entirely a story told by the powerless**. It is not the typical story told by the victors. It is written by the powerless for the powerless. In fact, it repeatedly condemns the powerful.\n\nThose two realities are going to conflict with each other. I am not by most measures the primary target audience of the Bible. It will take me work to set aside my own privilege in order to understand what the Bible is saying.\n\nThe Jedi didn't even seem to have a starting point for understanding how they misinterpret the prophecy passed down to them, or at least it is never explained. For modern Western parallels, though, I can think of two major ways we avoid acknowledging the upside-down nature of so much of the Bible.\n\n## Put it in the Future\n\nI'm not going to delve into any particular biblical texts, but I would say a major way we do this in the prosperous West is to make it about the present or some future date. The Bible was meaningful to those who read it. They haven't put in thousands of hours of work maintaining these texts for 2000 years for it to suddenly be useful for the first time, just to us. We're first and foremost reading about what God had to say to them. Most Christians seem to be able to agree to this in theory, but don't really want to go any farther than that with any implications that may not be all about them.\n\nTo be clear, I do believe that all the Bible is useful to us now. But being useful to us now does not mean that it was written exclusively for us to prop up whatever we already believed. In fact, I think a big part of what makes the Bible useful now is by understanding its original context and learning to set aside our own privilege enough to understand what a radical message God offers the oppressed.\n\n## Persecution Complex\n\nThe other major way I see that we make it about us is to be completely blind to what real persecution and real suffering looks like. I'm not saying bad things don't happen to rich white men, but we're definitely talking about a different scale. I don't have to worry about eating today. I just ate two cookies. They were delicious. This may be shocking to many: a significant portion of the world cannot afford to eat delicious Christmas cookies because they feel like it today. So, in order to try to relate to the Bible's prophecies that are primarily about helping particular historical oppressed groups, we have to at least try to make ourselves feel oppressed. We end up with situations like being upset because there isn't a snowman on my $8 coffee cup, even though the Bible is talking about people who are starving and being slaughtered by a brutal emperor. We want to make the Bible relevant to us today, but instead of trying to approach the Bible by becoming like the people it was written by, to, and for, we work some mental gymnastics to pretend it's really talking about us already, no extra inconvenience necessary.\n\nTo me, a simple step here is to be aware of the reality of the world. Here's one example: my income makes me richer than approximately 99.6% of the world. That's not adjusting for purchasing power, but it's safe to say I'm at least in the 90th percentile and probably still around the 95th. Just to use personal consumer technology as an example, between my wife and I, we own a desktop, 2 laptops (1 mostly broken), 3 tablets, 3 smartphones (1 partially broken), multiple hard drives including two network storage devices for backup and a media server, and an Xbox One. Most of the world can't afford most of that. I have all of these things while making pretty much right on the Canadian national average adult income. I'm not particularly wealthy using a scale of Canada, so when I'm tempted to do a comparison there, I feel justified in being selfish. But when I step back, I realize how incredibly privileged I am. When the Bible talks about helping the poor, I'm not the poor it's talking about.\n\n## Bringing Balance to the Bible\n\nLet's not make the same mistake as the Jedi assuming that prophecies are written to them, about them, and for their benefit. The Star Wars prophecy turned out to radically shift the power dynamics of the galaxy. The Bible does that a lot more than those of us with privilege want to admit, too.\n","date":"2015-12-23T21:46:00.000Z"},"/2016/allegiance-to-a-label/":{"id":"/2016/allegiance-to-a-label/","title":"Allegiance to a Label","description":"A meditation on abandoning the language of evangelicalism.","tags":"posts Church Politics","content":"\nLinguistics 101: language changes. Language assigns words or phrases as a way to communicate different ideas. These ideas are not fixed for eternity. English is very different today than it was 1000 years ago. Before that, there were several source languages that became English. Even today, we are adding new words and phrases every year. Language is inherently arbitrary, with the exception of onomatopoeia. That's just how language works.\n\nThis is significant for me when talking about questions like why I don't identify as an \"evangelical\" anymore. Yes, I used to. And yes, by most historical definitions, I would probably still qualify. In the 18th and 19th centuries, even the first half of the 20th, \"evangelical\" was the majority of Christians. It meant something specific about how you approached the Bible: as authority but something that must be studied and wrestled with. It was the middle ground between liberals who assumed that the Bible was fundamentally untrustworthy and fundamentalists who refused to ask any questions, preferring to retrench in what their tradition had told them.\n\nThat's not really true anymore. For most people, \"evangelical\" and \"fundamentalist\" are synonyms. There are still many in that middle ground of approaching the Bible, myself included. It's not like that idea has faded out. It's just that the language has changed. Evangelical doesn't mean somebody who faithfully but humbly engages with the Bible.\n\nBeyond that, lots of ideas have been added to the definition. If I asked 100 people on the street what they thought evangelical meant, they would probably say things like:\n\n- Anti-science\n- Anti-women\n- Anti-LGBTQ\n- Anti-academia\n- Committed to a violent penal substitutionary view of atonement\n- Committed to biblical inerrancy\n- Exclusive\n- Angry\n- Stubborn\n- Votes conservative\n- Capitalist\n- Anti-abortion rights\n\nNone of those apply to me. There might be 1 or 2 percent of other answers that would apply - belief in personally encountering Jesus in your life, perhaps - but definitely a minority. So why would I keep causing unnecessary confusion by using a label that means something completely different to almost everyone in North America hearing it than what I mean by saying it? Stubbornness that I own the label more than everyone else does? That's not how language works. And even more importantly, to prove that their English is not as arbitrarily correct as my English is really not high on my list of priorities for following Jesus.\n\nThe Anabaptist label also is an instance of language changing. Anabaptist means re-baptizers. It was a slur, an insult, by Catholics and Protestants. Anabaptists don't believe in re-baptizing. We believe in believer's baptism, by definition making the first infant baptism not really a baptism and the believer's baptism the first. But they ultimately claimed the slur for themselves and it no longer carries the negative connotations or even really is associated with second baptisms (this is why it is ok for oppressed groups to reclaim and redefine the insults of their oppressors while not being ok for the oppressors to keep using it). Usually in my experience, the first thing people say now about defining Anabaptism is nonviolence. That took time, but the language changed.\n\nHere's the bottom line: my allegiance is not to any label. My allegiance was never to being known as an evangelical. My allegiance now is not being known as an Anabaptist. Sure, there would be some annoyances if I had to change my blog name again, as I already have a few times in the years of doing this, but that's about it. If Anabaptist as popularly defined ever ceases to describe me, I will stop using it to describe me. I was even on board with a brief stage where many people stopped calling themselves Christians, opting for \"Follower of Christ\", because there was so much cultural baggage. I'm not sure in that case it actually helped alleviate confusion, but our hearts and our understanding of language was in the right place. If Christian does stop describing me and there's a better term, I'll start using that term instead.\n\nMy allegiance is to Jesus. My faith is in Jesus. Language changes, and I am ok with that, but Jesus does not. Settling for putting my faith in definitions of any particular label is both idolatry and completely misunderstanding how language works.\n","date":"2016-01-28T10:30:00.000Z"},"/2016/life-after-jesus/":{"id":"/2016/life-after-jesus/","title":"Sermon: Life After Jesus","description":"A sermon about witnessing for Jesus after the ascencion.","tags":"posts","content":"\n## Intro - Farewell Frodo\n\nThere's a major difference in the endings between _The Lord of the Rings_ books and the movies. After the hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin have saved the day, they return home to the Shire. The Shire was an idyllic natural paradise, with minimal industrial interference. It's also succeeded in being safely tucked away, free from the great violent struggles that have consumed so much of this fantasy world called Middle Earth.\n\nIn the movie, the hobbits return to the Shire exactly as they remembered it. They are seen relaxing in a pub and Sam even gets married. Not only is the Shire a virtual paradise, but all of the other nations of Middle Earth live in peace with each other, too. It's a classic Hollywood ending, suggesting that everybody will now be living happily ever after, with evil completely defeated.\n\nIn the books, the Shire is in a very different condition when the hobbits return, starting an extensive epilogue. Instead of being their own Garden of Eden, the Shire is being terrorized by the evil wizard Saruman. Sam plays an important part in the uprising, along with the other hobbits Merry and Pippin. Frodo, who had been the central character in the main quest, participates but not to the same degree. According to the appendices, Sam becomes mayor later, continuing to play an important role in restoring life as they had previously known it.\n\nAs we look at the Ascension story told in Acts, the story could similarly break from here into either of those two directions. We might disagree on the details of how the atonement worked, but Christians can generally agree that Jesus somehow defeated evil with his life, death, and resurrection. But what comes next?\n\nThe movie version is tempting, with everything tying up in a nice neat bow and everybody living in harmony. You can argue that for many years of Mennonite history, they tried to live similar to that of the hobbits in the Shire, sequestered away from the evils of the world.\n\nBut the movie version is not very realistic. It's not what happened in the rest of the biblical story. It's not what happened in the early Church history that followed. The early Christians became known for their willingness to care for the poor, for rushing into towns hit by a plague to help the dying, and for empowering women and slaves. They were not sequestered away avoiding the problems of the world.\n\nTwo thousand years later, we say that Jesus defeated evil and death, but evil and death still exist. We're left with the choice of what we're going to do about that: we can try to hide away, or we can get our hands dirty continuing to work for the kind of justice Jesus exemplified.\n\nThere is one piece of the story that is the same in both versions of Lord of the Rings, however. Frodo, haunted and exhausted by his journey, decides to leave Middle Earth for the Undying Lands where he can be at peace. It's probably best to think of this as a happy retirement. The parallel to Jesus only extends so far, I know. There are none of the equivalent aspects of Jesus' continued authority over the world, eternal life, or a promise of a return – in fact, Frodo makes it clear that he will not return. But those aren't the parts I want to focus on today.\n\nBefore leaving, Sam speaks to Frodo. He sees that Frodo is putting the finishing touches on the book where he had written down the story of their adventure, so Sam asks if he's finished it. Frodo looks at Sam, hands him the book, and says: \"Not quite. There's room for a little more. The last pages are for you, Sam.\"\n\nThroughout the main quest, Sam was essentially the sidekick. It's true that Frodo never would have succeeded without him, but it was no question that Frodo was the centre of the story. That changes with Frodo's departure. The primary actor in the story has shifted. The torch has been passed from Frodo to Sam, and especially in the book version, it is clear that there is still work to be done, despite the climax of the story being past.\n\nThere is a similar passing of the torch here in the Ascension story.\n\n## Concluding Act 4\n\nIn order for that passing of the torch to make sense, though, I need to zoom out a bit more to look at the big picture of the story. Try to put yourself in the shoes of the disciples for a few minutes. They started following this rabbi named Jesus. For some including the Twelve this might have been about 3 years, others would have been less than that. In many cases, they set aside their livelihoods to follow Jesus immediately when first given the chance.\n\nWhat they expected from Jesus as they started out may not have been the same for all of them. At the simplest level, the Twelve were probably simply good Jewish boys who were not going to turn down an opportunity to apprentice to a rabbi. The fact that most of them were working in their family trade suggests that they were not good enough to have been recruited by a different rabbi when they were younger. Jesus recruits these people who are considered not good enough, and they jump at the opportunity, without really knowing the extent of what they were getting themselves into.\n\nThey probably did not imagine many of the things that would happen in those three years. For example, Jesus did not just reinterpret the Torah and the rest of the Hebrew Bible, as rabbis were free to do. Sometimes he blatantly overruled it, claiming that his authority is greater than the Bible, with phrases like \"you have heard it said… but I tell you…\"\n\nOr how about telling the religious leaders that they go out and make converts just to turn them into twice the sons of Hell that they are? That's my personal favourite of Jesus' many prophetic insults. That's not the kind of thing you expect from your rabbi.\n\nAs they began to identify Jesus as the Messiah, or Christ, that brought a lot of other expectations. First century Jews believed that a Messiah would free them from under the boot of the oppressive Romans and restore Israel to its proper glory like it had in the days of David. They had some different ideas about how this would happen. They may have emphasized victory through military leadership or proper temple practices or calling everyone back to living holy lives or some combination of all of these. Jesus again didn't deliver on expectations.\n\nAfter 3 years of public ministry, Jesus gets killed by those same Romans. He didn't even fight back. How is Jesus going to overthrow the Romans if he lets them kill him? And then Resurrection, the climax of the Jesus story. Jesus defeats death. The lives of the disciples have been completely turned upside down in the last 3 years.\n\nThe biblical scholar N.T. Wright has put forward an approach to reading the Bible that I find quite helpful. Wright invites us to look at the Bible like a dramatic play. This drama has five acts: 1. creation, 2. fall, 3. Israel, 4. Jesus, and 5. the Church. Each are important, but we don't try to interpret them all in the same way.\n\nHave you ever seen a movie with a surprise twist ending that completely changes how you see everything that came before it? The best example I can think of is an old one - The Sixth Sense – but you might be able to fill in a different example. If you watch it again while knowing the twist that is on the way, you see the same actions and listen to the same words. But you understand them completely differently than if you were just watching the first part of the movie without knowledge of what's coming.\n\nThat's what Jesus does with the biblical narrative. He's the twist to the story that forces us to reconsider everything that came before that.\n\nThis framework of the Bible having these acts within one overarching story has helped me understand the Ascension more. The Ascension marks the end of act 4 – the incarnate Jesus story - and helps push us into act 5 – the Church.\n\n## Acts 1:1-11\n\nBefore Jesus ascends, the disciples ask him a question: \"are you going to restore the Kingdom to Israel now?\" This tells me that, at least to some degree, they still don't really get it. They're still waiting for Jesus to be the violent messiah that overthrows the Romans.\n\nThe disciples still seem to expect those were just some nice clichés but now that Jesus is back, he can get down to the real business. This is, unfortunately, a mindset that we often fall into ourselves. We think of justice as punishing the bad guys and giving the power to the good guys, with each of us having our own definition of who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. Many Christians today even believe that Jesus will come back some day and look completely different than the first time, \"with a sword in his hand and a commitment to make someone bleed\" to quote one popular preacher.\n\nJesus answers in his usual cryptic way, essentially stating that's not something they need to know. And then he says something that doesn't seem to be related. He tells the disciples that the Holy Spirit is coming and they will be witnesses, not just in Israel but expanding outward to Samaria. We could read this as Jesus answering a question he wasn't asked because he doesn't want to acknowledge their question that is still missing the point.\n\nI think he's answering it in a different way, though. Asked if HE was going to restore Israel now, he tells them that THEY will be given the Holy Spirit and will be his witnesses, starting with the same Israel they just asked about. What if that's how Jesus plans to restore the world, through us continuing his work?\n\nIt's not just us stumbling along on our own – this commission is tied to the promise of the Holy Spirit. Jesus will continue to be with us in that sense. He also tells us elsewhere that he is present in the marginalized people we encounter around us and whenever we gather in his name, as the Church. So it may not quite be Frodo disappearing and never coming back, but this still has to be a very hard moment for the disciples as they tried to figure out what to do next.\n\nThe key word in this commission is \"witness.\" It is a fairly straightforward word, although it does have some baggage in our current religious context, conjuring up images of street corner preachers yelling about how you'll go to Hell if you don't believe or do the right things. Witnessing simply means to share with others what you have experienced. Strictly speaking, most street preachers I've run into aren't actually witnessing – they're just preaching doctrine.\n\nBeing a witness should not be a particularly controversial phrase. This past week I have experienced multiple NBA basketball playoff games and I've experienced a presentation on the future of Microsoft SharePoint. While the basketball games are usually more exciting, what I learned in the SharePoint presentation probably has more practical benefit to how I live my life. I will likely be witnesses to both in the coming weeks, the NBA games being more in talking about how great it was the Raptors won last night, and SharePoint more in implementing new features in my work.\n\nWhen it comes to Jesus, you'll probably have some times when witnessing is exciting. But the feeling of excitement is not a primary descriptor of following Jesus. Encountering Jesus does always have practical implications, though. Shane Claiborne put it this way in his book _The Irresistible Revolution_:\n\n> Then I met Jesus and he wrecked my life. The more I read the gospel, the more it messed me up, turning everything I believed in, valued, and hoped for upside down. I am still recovering from my conversion.\n\nI love that statement. Encountering Jesus wrecks your life, in the best way possible. To witness to that is to live and to speak out of those new values like peacemaking, mercy, and restorative rather than punitive justice.\n\n## Great Commission\n\nThat brings us around to another term that Jesus uses in a different recording of his last words to the disciples, and that is… well, disciples. You might be familiar with this version, often referred to as the Great Commission:\n\n> All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19 Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.\n\nLike the commission in the Ascension story in Acts, this is a passing of the torch, a call to continue Jesus' mission. There are other similarities, too, like the claim to authority and the promise of always being with us.\n\nBut the key verb is different: making disciples rather than witnessing. A disciple is somebody who does what the teacher does, not just somebody who theoretically agrees with what the teacher said. Looking back on the life of Jesus, he spent most of his time doing very practical things like healing people, feeding people, and tearing down walls of inequality with his words and actions. And he made disciples, inviting other people to follow him, too.\n\nTony Jones has referred to the Bible as propaganda. That's another word we generally don't like very much. We associate it with things like blind support for military violence. But the basic idea is that propaganda is a story told with the purpose of inviting you to be a part of something bigger. Jesus still invites you to follow him, and for those who have accepted that invitation, challenges us to invite others through our words and actions continuing on his Kingdom vision.\n\n## 2 Corinthians 5:14-20\n\nThere's one more label given to Christians I wanted to touch on, this time from Paul in 2 Corinthians: \"ambassador.\"\n\nAmbassador is a much more politically loaded word. To be the ambassador of Canada to Germany means that you are a representative of Canada to the government and people of Germany. There are many ways that you can and probably should be active in German life. But that's not ultimately where your loyalty lies. Your loyalty lies with Canada, even while in the context of Germany.\n\nThe same can be said for being ambassadors for Jesus in Paul's context and in our own. Our loyalty lies with Jesus, and we're left to figure out what that means in our context. It's a similar term to \"witnesses\" and \"disciples\" in that we represent Jesus to the world, but carries that extra tension. Being an ambassador does mean we will sometimes be counter-cultural with the ways that the world usually operates. It's not being counter-cultural only for the sake of being counter-cultural, which is a trap we sometimes fall into, but because we actually believe Jesus' way is better.\n\nOne thing it will definitely mean is that we are reconcilers. Unless we do have the privilege of only surrounding ourselves with people like ourselves, we can see divisions between people all around us. There are divisions between rich and poor. There are divisions between men, women, and those who don't fall on a gender binary. There are divisions between races, and nationalities, and ages, and sexual orientations. And so on and so on. Humanity does have a remarkable ability to find reasons to feel superior to and threatened by people even just a little bit different than us.\n\nThere's a lot of people in this congregation who have a lot more practical peacemaking experience than I do, so I'm not going to pretend to sound like an expert on the practical details. There is one big theological starting point in this text, though. We no longer see people from a human point of view, according to Paul. This does not mean pretending human differences don't exist. There are a lot of problems with the idea of colour-blindness as it is popularly used to dismiss very real racism, for example.\n\nThe Bible starts with humanity being made in God's image. The climax of the story has God loving every single person so much as to die on a cross. And now, as Jesus has passed the torch to the Church, we are commissioned to see people in the same kind of way that God sees us. Whenever we see a person, we are asked to agree with God that they are these two things: God's image and infinitely loved. Jesus extended love to anybody he encountered and broke down societal walls.\n\nAs his witnesses, disciples, and ambassadors, we are invited to go and do likewise. In this great drama, we are actors. How are we going to be a part of restoring the world?\n","date":"2016-05-08T10:30:00.000Z"},"/2016/sin-sunday/":{"id":"/2016/sin-sunday/","title":"Sermon: Sin Sunday","description":"A sermon about everybody's favourite topic: sin.","tags":"posts","content":"\n## Text\n\n[Confession of Faith](https://www.mennonitechurch.ca/cof), article 7\n\n[Romans 7:15-20](https://bibles.org/bible/1fd99b0d5841e19b-02/ROM.7?passageId=ROM.7.15-ROM.7.20&q=romans%207%3A15-20)\n\n## Transcript\n\nWelcome to Sin Sunday. If you saw the sermon title in the bulletin before today and decided to still come, good for you, thank you. If you did not see the sermon title and are now worrying about what you got yourself into, I'm sorry, but you're already here so you may as well stick around and give me a chance?\n\nWe started doing this off and on series through the Confession of Faith in a Mennonite Perspective way back in the winter. Part of the reasoning for doing this series was to specifically say some of the big theological ideas in the confession. It's a bit of a Mennonite Theology 101, which can often go simply assumed as we happily preach about other things. I think that motivation is especially true for the less comfortable topics like today's, sin.\n\nLet's dive into the awkwardness with the most obvious question: what is sin?\n\nIf you ask the average person what they think sin is, you'll probably get something like what Ted Danson explains in the TV show The Good Place. A group of people have died and arrived in \"the good place.\" They are given an orientation video that explains why they are in the Good Place.\n\nEssentially, it says that sins are bad things. There's a scale of these bad things as well as a scale of good things. Commit genocide is a negative 433,373 points. Makes sense. Telling a woman to \"smile\" is negative 53 points. Being the commissioner of a professional football league (American) is negative 824 points, but on the other hand for football fans, you can get positive 53 points if you manage to stay loyal to the Cleveland Browns. Then at the end of your life you get judged based on how all the good things you did and the bad things you did balance out. The people with the highest scores end up in The Good Place, everybody else in The Bad Place.\n\n### Missing the Mark\n\nThat's not really the definition of sin that we see in the Bible, though.\n\nThe Greek word in the New Testament which we most commonly translate as sin is hamartia, which means missing the mark. It started as an archery term.\n\nThat begs the question \"what is the mark that we're missing, what is the bullseye?\" In a lot of the Western Christian tradition, the answer might be something to do with God's Law. The Western Church really loves a legal framework. It's basically the framework of The Good Place: break a rule, build up some negative points.\n\nThe confession's definition is that sin is turning away from God and making gods of creation and of ourselves. I read that and had a harder time grasping what it practically means when framed as a negative like that, so let's spin that around and say that if sin is turning away from God, then the target is God.\n\nOk, that makes more sense to me, and gets us much closer to a framework that is more Hebraic and biblical: discipleship. The goal of a disciple is to become like their teacher, to have living like their teacher as their bullseye. In our case, that is Jesus.\n\n### Sin By Commission or Omission\n\nThis makes it easier to understand another point which the confession does a good job of handling: sins of commission and sins of omission. Failing to love is also missing the mark, not just actively harming. Just saying that I'm going to try to get through life without directly choosing to harm somebody is a pretty tempting approach in our individualistic Western world.\nIt runs into some trouble with Jesus' teaching, though, if we stopped there. Jesus' harshest criticisms were to those who had the resources to actively love people and yet did nothing. Take for example, a well-known story. A man identified as a rich young ruler comes to Jesus asking what else he needs to do, asserting that he follows all the commandments. No sins of commission for him. Jesus tells him to give up everything he has and give it to the poor. The guy went away sad. Most of us can at least in theory get behind the idea of not directly harming other people, but to actively sacrifice from our own privileges for the sake of others is a lot tougher to swallow.\n\nThere's a scene in the movie _Batman Begins_ which illustrates this distinction. I'm not going to show it because it annoys me too much every time I see it. In the final big fight scene, Batman has effectively defeated Ra's Al Ghul on a train that is hurtling at full speed about to blow up. Ra's is pinned down by Batman holding a weapon to his head and says, \"you finally learned to do what is necessary,\" which is referencing Batman's one rule that he never kills anybody. Batman responds, \"I won't kill you, but I don't have to save you either.\" Then Batman jumps off the train and leaves Ra's to his death.\n\nExcuse me, but that's a really stupid loophole. You won't kill but you'll beat somebody up and hold him in a place where you know he will be killed? That is not a moral high ground. In that moment, Batman doesn't actively harm Ra's, he just chooses not to help. This is an extreme overdramatic example, I know, but a lot of people would subscribe to this idea that my conscience is clean as long as I don't actively hurt other people.\n\n### Individual and Communal\n\nThat idea extends into another major point: individual and communal sin. This is important especially as we get into heated \"political\" topics. Left wing politicians and voters tend to focus heavily on the systemic sins which are causing widespread harm. Right wing politicians and voters tend to focus heavily on the individual's free will. We act like these are two radically contradictory sentiments when both can be true at the same time.\n\nTake our environmental destruction for example. Last week we saw yet another report, even more dramatic than previous ones, about how little time we have left to make massive changes before this planet stops supporting human life. I saw two different responses. Some focused on what individuals can do to lower our carbon footprint. Eat less meat, or at least less factory-farmed meat. Use a smart thermostat like the one we have here at the front of the church. And so on.\n\nThen I saw others mocking that response, pointing out for example that we know 71% of worldwide pollution comes from just 100 companies. Without a significant change in our economic system that encourages these companies to create so much damage, our individual changes might feel like a drop in the bucket.\n\nWhat I would want to say is that both are true. You can make lifestyle changes that will make a difference, especially as more and more people make the same changes. And we can use our voice to encourage stronger environmental actions from our governments and companies who we might buy from. One of them does not cancel out the other, and realistically at least in this case, we probably need a lot of both.\n\nOr maybe I should say that I saw three different responses, because often we start with one of those two and then conclude that we can't actually do anything, so we're off the hook.\n\nIf we only talk about racism, for example, as systemic and subconscious, we – speaking to white people here - might conclude that there's nothing we as individuals can do about it because we are too small and insignificant in the grand scheme. We end up continuing to benefit from and perpetuate the system.\n\nOn the other hand, if it's only a heart issue isolated to a select group of people, then it's again out of our control. To quote Samantha Field, one of my favourite bloggers: \"if Jim is a racist turd,\" there's nothing for me to do about it – that's for the Holy Spirit to convict. It also lets us off the hook from working together at an institutional level to change things which might have contributed to Jim being a racist turd.\n\nEither way, we've successfully dodged responsibility for anything other than the obviously conscious sins we commit.\n\n### Conviction and Shame\n\nWell, you might be feeling guilty right now. You might be feeling convicted. Or you might be feeling ashamed. There's a difference between those ideas, although we might not always use the language the same way so it is important to be clear about what we mean by each.\n\nIf you remember nothing else from today, I would focus on this: sin is about the things we do or we fail to do. _You_ are not a sin. You are not \"just a sinner.\" Sin is real and should be acknowledged, but it does not subtract from your value in any way.\n\nBrene Brown is one of the most well-known researchers of shame and vulnerability, and has had a few TED talks on the topic. Originally I had the video here and showed it, but I don't remember all these years later exactly which video I used and which part of it. So I'll go from the context to add the key points:\n\n- Guilt, or conviction, is a healthy feeling that you have done something wrong or failed to do something good. That's for you to learn from and try to do better.\n- Shame is unhealthy, feeling like you are worth less.\n\nThis is where the Scripture text for today from Romans comes in. I love this text in part because it's kind of confusing the first time, which I think helps prove the point that it is making. Paul says that even when he has a pretty good idea of what is right, he still sometimes messes it up. Which I think is great to say in a way that presumably tries to be clear but fails. Paul simultaneously acknowledges that the real him is somebody who is good. He's aiming for the right bullseye of following Jesus, but sometimes he misses.\n\nI think this is a healthy way to think about ourselves. At the core of our being is what was talked about in the last article of the confession: we are image bearers of God, infinitely loved by God. No matter how much you mess up, that never goes away.\n\nIt also doesn't make sin any less real. We do truly mess up. There are some people who think they have never done anything wrong, particularly socially important people who can more easily get away with not seeing consequences for their actions. Sometimes people just need you to help them recognize that they are causing harm. Jesus tells a parable about an unjust judge who finally gives in and grants justice because a woman kept yelling at him. Given what dominated the news for a couple of weeks recently, I don't think I need to expand on that parable too much except to say that sometimes sin needs to be pointed out.\n\nThis is not just for the benefit of the victims, but for the perpetrator, too. 10 years ago I had far less awareness of things like white supremacy and patriarchy and how I benefit from them, let alone my personal failings. Sure, I needed to be somewhat responsive when people tried to explain issues to me. But I wouldn't be where I am today if people didn't sometimes find a way to help me see that the thing I'm doing is hurting people. And I'm sure I'm not done, so I hope people can find loving ways to keep calling me in when necessary.\n\n### Repentance\n\nThis realizing that we've done harm is the first step in repentance, and why Brene Brown can talk about guilt being adaptive, unlike shame. To give you another Greek word for the day, the Bible uses _metanoia_ which is often translated as repent. It literally means to turn around. It has nothing to do with sitting and wailing about how much I suck, nothing to do with shame as Brene Brown put it.\n\nI like how the Common English Bible translates it: \"change your hearts and lives.\" It's a very practical translation and an accurate one. You were going in one direction that was causing harm to yourself and others. Stop doing that and go in a different direction. Jesus talks about this in hyperbolic language: cutting out your eye if it causes you to sin. The apostle Paul gave a less hyperbolic version in one of his letters: if you are stealing, stop and go get honest work instead.\n\nI've been thinking a lot lately about whether we've lost the concept of repentance as a culture. When somebody has done something bad, I usually see two responses:\n\n1. It doesn't really matter. We need to forgive him (usually a him) and pretend it didn't happen. Or,\n2. He's a terrible human being who should be permanently exiled from public life because of the thing he did years ago.\n\nNeither really have any suggestion of what it takes to make things right when you've done something harmful. One rushes to forgiveness regardless of repentance and one rushes to judgement regardless of repentance.\n\nIf we do talk about repentance, we often boil it down to just saying you're sorry. We can end up with concepts like white guilt. Maybe using Brene Brown's terminology it would be better to call it white shame. We may sincerely be sorry about residential schools, or slavery, or racially-biased police brutality still today. But we just wallow in that shame, feeling bad about ourselves and never get to the hard repentance part, which means the harm is still there, sometimes for hundreds of years.\n\nWhat does repentance look like? Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg, described the Jewish view of repentance this way, specifically discussing in the context of celebrities returning to public life after being called out in the MeToo movement:\n\n> There are specific steps to repentance work:\n>\n> 1. owning the harm perpetrated (ideally publicly);\n> 2. do the work to become the kind of person who doesn't do harm (which requires a ton of inner work)\n> 3. Make restitution for harm done, in whatever way possible\n> 4. THEN apologize for the harm caused in whatever way that will make it as right as possible with the victim\n> 5. when faced with the opportunity to cause similar harm in the future, make a better choice.\n\nThat is not easy – much tougher than simply saying I'm sorry or hoping that it will blow over – but if we are willing to do it, we can at least partly heal the harm done as well as to learn how to avoid making the same mistakes again.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSin is a heavy topic, but it's one that we need to be able to confront so we can turn around – or repent - away from it and make things better. I wanted to end with some hope, so I requested we sing \"My Soul Cries Out\", titled in most hymn books as Canticle of the Turning. This is probably my favourite hymn because it so clearly names systemic sin, for one, and calls for a turning or a repentance to something better. But it is so hopeful in how it does it. The world is about to turn. The last 2 or 3 years the news has really dragged down my optimism about humanity. It does not feel like the world is about to turn, at least not toward anything better. And yet I choose to continue to hope that God is at work in the world and invites us to partner in that turning.\n","date":"2016-05-08T10:30:00.000Z"},"/2016/atonement-god-jd-myers/":{"id":"/2016/atonement-god-jd-myers/","title":"The Atonement of God by J.D. Myers","description":"A book review about non-violent atonement and some implications.","tags":"posts Books","content":"\n![The Atonement of God by J.D. Myers (cover)](./atonement-god-myers.jpg)\n\nA few years ago I was strongly considering writing a book. My premise was essentially a systematic theology but starting with the idea that God looks like Jesus, particularly when it comes to rejection of violence. *The Atonement of God* by J.D. Myers is the closest I've encountered to trying for the same goal, with a couple of significant differences:\n\n- It is not nearly as comprehensive as a systematic theology, sticking to topics that are directly related to a non-violent understanding of the atonement.\n- The starting point is a non-violent understanding of the atonement in particular, rather than a non-violent God in general.\n\nMaybe that excitement biased me, but I felt like the book was only moderately successful.\n\n### Style\n\nMy main complaints are related to the style, not the content. It feels sloppily written. It often gets very repetitive, which meant that although it was a short book, it probably could have been half the size. It doesn't really do a good job explaining what is meant by some terms, such as pacifism (see below). It uses gendered language, and I don't just mean some that are very understandable like male pronouns for God - I mean regularly using \"man\" to mean humanity. If this was written 50 years ago or even 20 years, that wouldn't bother me, but at some point if you're writing a book about a non-violent God, you should stop and think about whether your language is cutting out half of the image of the God.\n\n### Content\n\nWhen it comes to content, I'm less critical. The strength of the book is when he explains his understanding of a non-violent atonement. I have read a few of these in recent years, most notably J. Denny Weaver's *The Nonviolent Atonement.*\n\n#### Christus Victor\n\nThe best part of the book is explaining how in this theory he understands Jesus defeated Satan, sin, and death. At risk of oversimplification:\n\nJesus defeated sin in that we no longer need to be afraid and ashamed when we sin, knowing God loves us regardless. We are free from the lie that God is separated from us because of sin.\n\nJesus defeated Satan. Satan is the Hebrew word for accuser. Satan is the one who is always playing the judgemental card, claiming we can't truly be loved by God because we aren't good enough. This part wasn't new to me, but is very important to remember this shame should be rejected as from Satan, not embraced as from God.\n\nJesus' defeat of death was the most fascinating as well as new to me. Myers argued that when the Bible talks about being slaves to death before Jesus freed us, it isn't talking about our own death. Obviously we still die, although most Christians would believe that some day we will not. Instead, Myers argues that Jesus frees us from being enslaved to the death of others - the scapegoat impulse that requires us to kill others in order to feel better about ourselves.\n\nThis began with Cain killing Abel. Myers offered a good insight for why God would reject Cain's offering. Cain probably grew up hearing the promise to his mother that one of her children would crush the serpent and restore human life to the Garden of Eden. He likely had it in his mind that it was his job to repay God for the fruit his parents ate, in order to win back God's love. The problem was that God never stopped loving him. Cain believed a lie and that caused him to create religion, in the worst sense of the word, and God rejected it to say it was not necessary. Abel made a sacrifice, but it was without this desire to win over God, so it was accepted. Cain then got angry at his brother and committed the first murder. When God explains the consequences to Cain, it is Cain who adds separation from God to the list, seeing it as punishment rather than consequence.\n\n#### Peace\n\nThe last chapter unfortunately soured the book for me a little. Myers claims that it is a discussion of the idea of peace as seen through the non-violent atonement. He immediately states that he is not a pacifist and doesn't think we should be. He never explains what he means by pacifism, although he seems to think it means being passive. This is another case where a stronger editor would have been helpful.\n\nBut that wasn't the biggest problem with this section. The heart of the chapter was that the key to peace is accepting blame, to see ourselves as the enemy. In many cases I do not disagree. Taking responsibility for our own actions is essential to making peace. There's that phrase \"love means never having to say you're sorry.\" That is a terrible idea. Love means being quick to say you're sorry for the good of the other person, rather than holding on to your pride or shame. But I do think Myers goes too far, saying things like that everybody is always partly to blame for a conflict. He even argues that God was partly to blame for the existence of sin by virtue of giving us free will and the cross was God accepting his true blame. That seems like a stretch to me and I think it is much more powerful (and accurate) to say that God took our punishment even though completely innocent, a true scapegoat.\n\nWhere it becomes a problem, though, is the reality that not all violence is a two-way problem. What does this say to a woman being abused by her partner on a daily basis? According to Myers, she should reflect on how she is really the enemy and has \"contributed to the anger and hostility and violence directed toward \\[her\\]\" (155). That's the recipe for perpetual abuse, which I do not for a second think is what Jesus wants. After he rejects pacifism, seemingly because he thought it was the same as being passive, he then goes on to say that we should be mostly passive rather than actively pacifying the violence.\n\nWe should definitely examine ourselves and open ourselves to vulnerable critique from others we trust. We should be quick to apologize and repent if we have contributed to the violence of the situation. But sometimes there really are victims in a situation and I strongly disagree with telling those victims to contemplate their sin until it gets better. That creates another scapegoat, which Jesus came to end, not peace.\n\n_Disclosure: I received this book from Speakeasy in exchange for a fair review._\n","date":"2016-07-19T21:46:00.000Z"},"/2017/rebellions-hope/":{"id":"/2017/rebellions-hope/","title":"Rebellions are Built on Hope","description":"What does the Good Place have to say about concepts of sin?","tags":"posts Movies and TV MennoNerds","content":"\nThe following was written for a MennoNerds vlog.\n\n## Video\n\n\n\n## Transcript\n\nThis is probably my favourite photo I've ever taken. It was during a thunderstorm last summer with an amazing purple sky, looking out from our balcony. In the centre of the shot is the cross at the top of the Lutheran church right beside our apartment building.\n\n![3-dimensional cross from church in front of purple stormy sky](./stormy-sky.jpg)\n\nI'm not particularly artistic, but I couldn't help but see some meaning here in the way this photo turned out, a message that seems particularly strong during Lent.\n\nWe have this incredibly violent backdrop. Lent is a time when we are particularly aware of the suffering in the world, much like Jesus suffered in the days leading up to his death. But then, in the middle of this photo is a cross. On one hand, the cross is the ultimate symbol of suffering. It's an execution device, and an especially brutal one.\n\nWith resurrection coming, though, we know that this cross is also an incredible symbol of hope. And that hope, standing tall in the middle of a storm, is fascinating and vital.\n\nLast time I vlogged was about movies and TV. I did not mention the newest Star Wars movie, *Rogue One*. One line of the movie really stands out, though:\n\n> Rebellions are built on hope.\n\nThis is a valuable reminder particularly in times that seem like hatred and violence are on the rise. Rebellions need to be keenly aware of the evils against which they are rebelling. We can't dress wounds and pretend they aren't serious, saying there's peace when there isn't, an attitude that Jeremiah 6:14 condemns. We need to stare at that thunderstorm, acknowledge the harm it will cause, and be ready to truly help those who have experienced that harm. We need to be ready to the point of picking up our own cross, as Jesus was. This is one of the reminders of Lent.\n\nWe can't do it without hope, though. Rebellions don't last long without hope. It makes sense. If you don't have a vision of a better world, the best you can do is dismantle the problems with nothing to replace them. Think of the death of important leaders throughout history like Alexander the Great. When he died, his generals divided up his lands and then continued to fight each other over them. If there's a vacuum, somebody or something will fill it.\n\nThe prophets of the Bible seem to get this. There are a few exceptions, but most prophetic texts have both elements. They call out evil with no reservations. They also help us imagine a better world. Without that imagining, it is so easy to become discouraged and bitter, waging our Twitter fights but not actually knowing how to make the world better.\n\nJesus is the best example, of course. He challenges the powers of the world, political and religious. He points out the ways in which they dehumanize and exploit others for their own benefit. He is unapologetic about it and it gets him killed. And yet, he also proclaims that the Kingdom of God has come and this Kingdom is one of hope. Jesus gives us a vision of a God who loves all, a God who blesses the poor, the meek, and the peacemakers, a God who will even die to rescue us from those worldly powers that stop us reaching that vision. That is a glimmer of hope that can grow like a mustard seed, keeping us going even during the dark and stormy seasons like Lent.\n","date":"2017-02-20T21:46:00.000Z"},"/2017/swallowing-camel/":{"id":"/2017/swallowing-camel/","title":"Sermon: Swallowing a Camel","description":"A sermon about spiritual trauma and the trap of religious judgement.","tags":"posts","content":"\n## Scripture Texts\n\n[Amos 5:18-24](https://bibles.org/bible/1fd99b0d5841e19b-02/AMO.5?passageId=AMO.5.18-AMO.5.24&q=amos%205%3A18-24)\n\n[Matthew 23](https://bibles.org/bible/1fd99b0d5841e19b-02/MAT.23?passageId=MAT.23.1-MAT.23.10&q=matthew%2023)\n\n## Transcript\n\n### The Question\n\nWhen I was younger, I wondered why Jesus was killed. I grew up in a moderate evangelical church, so I was given a big theological explanation of why Jesus died - penal substitution - but not why he was killed. I was a naïve white kid who generally thought that people got what they deserved in terms of justice from the state, so an innocent man receiving a brutal death penalty was tough to wrap my head around. Why would the religious leaders and the political leaders of Jesus' day want to kill him, and how did they get away with it, if Jesus lived this perfect sinless life? Nobody else seemed to be curious about that question, or at least they didn't talk about it. This was before I really started caring about theology, so it mostly sat in the back of my mind for years, but I don't think the question ever fully went away.\n\nSeveral years later as a young adult, I was involved in a Christian community on my university campus. I could start to see that there was meaningful harm being done by this community to a lot of people.\n\nSomebody who I barely knew at the time came to help me as I struggled through this and he quoted some of Matthew 23. I think it was the part about making converts to be twice the sons of Hell that they are. I must have read the chapter before then, but it had never sunk in what Jesus was doing here.\n\nAt first, this gave me permission to acknowledge that maybe religious leaders get it wrong sometimes. That's a pretty important realization on its own. For the record, this is not a comment on our pastor or any of the other leadership at our church. I happen to think they do a pretty great job. But if you do see problems, you shouldn't be afraid to bring it up, in a loving way of course. I would not suggest jumping immediately to Jesus' more extreme language here in Matthew.\n\n### Jesus vs Religion\n\nAfter catching on to this in Matthew 23, I started to see it everywhere in the Gospels: Jesus did a lot to get the religious establishment angry at him. Most of the time it was a case of doing something against the Law for the sake of better loving somebody. He broke Sabbath rules. He had women among his disciples and touched both women and men who were deemed unclean. He routinely ate dinner with the worst of sinners. He rescued a woman caught in adultery, or as I've heard that story better labelled, he stood up to religious leaders caught in judgement. He turned holy water intended for important religious cleansing into wine. He adapted a reading from Scripture while teaching in the synagogue to eliminate the part about God's wrath on non-Jews. He blasphemed, equating himself to the Father, and warned that the holy Temple would be torn down.\n\nJesus was a religious leader himself and many scholars even argue he was more likely a Pharisee than any of the other sects of Judaism at the time. But he also clearly stood in opposition to them on many occasions. Now I understood why they would ally with the state to kill him.\n\nThis doesn't mean every religious person or even every religious leader stands in opposition to Jesus, of course. It helps to distinguish individual decisions from systemic problems. It's analogous to how we talk about racism. White people tend to talk about racism in terms of individual conscious decisions to discriminate. I'm sure part of that is because it lets us off the hook more easily, but we've also just been taught to think that way and didn't question it. It's why a lot of white people will get defensive when racism is mentioned, seeing themselves as under a personal attack. Black people tend to talk about racism in terms of systemic inequalities. We can have a lot of individuals who are not consciously choosing to see other races as inferior – we may even consciously see ourselves treating everybody equally - while those same people can be furthering a system that advantages them at the expense of others, without even realizing it. I may not be using racial slurs, but I do benefit from social systems of white supremacy, which I need to be able to acknowledge to do anything about it.\n\nI think that systemic injustice is what happens here with the scribes and Pharisees, too. It isn't beneficial to demonize the individuals. They weren't inherently evil people. Some even got on board with what Jesus was saying. They were, however, a part of a system that benefited them at the expense of others. I probably missed how radical Jesus was precisely because I took the easy way out by scapegoating the Pharisees as simply the bad guys. For the most part, they probably saw themselves as worshipping God the best they could, not in terms of hurting others.\n\n### Humanizing the Pharisees\n\nI find it helpful to put myself in the shoes of the scribes and Pharisees while listening to the things that Jesus said to them. It helps me remember their humanity, and most importantly, it helps me see how I could and sometimes do fall into the same trap.\n\n#### Burdens\n\nJesus says the Pharisees put unrealistic burdens on other people and then don't do anything to help them. Why would they do this? They probably believed that these burdens were helping the people. It's simple logic: if God gave a law that is good for humanity, aren't we better off with more people doing it? It's the same logic why conservatives might say that same-sex marriage shouldn't be recognized by the state, or why liberals might say that we need to heavily tax the rich and redistribute to the poor. Who is right and who is wrong is not the point right now. Those are debates for another day. For now, we can probably agree that if we think something is good, we are tempted to enforce it on others.\n\nLast weekend I listened to a podcast from [The Liturgists about spiritual trauma](http://www.theliturgists.com/podcast/2017/5/16/spiritual-trauma). The Liturgists make great content, but this was by far the most impactful episode for me. They shared stories from their listeners of spiritual trauma they had experienced. One person describes how his father beat them while quoting worship songs and Bible verses about children needing to obey their parents. One person describes a \"stoning\" of a woman – not throwing literal stones, but they did call it a stoning as they instead hurled insults at her. One describes being physically dragged by her pastor through the church after he found out she got a nose ring. It's a powerful episode, not just those stories but also great discussion with therapists and around other ideas like how to build healthier communities.\n\nThese examples are at the individual level. This isn't even talking about the big picture corporate evils that have been done in the name of religion, Christianity or otherwise. Blaise Pascal once said, \"Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious conviction.\" Crusades. Inquisition. Witch trials. Holocaust. The list goes on and on.\n\nI hear these stories and get angry. Then I also remember that like the Pharisees, the religious leaders causing the trauma probably thought they were doing a good and loving thing. And I realize that I have probably thought like them and probably did some serious damage along the way, too. This is a tension that we live in.\n\n#### Legalism\n\nWe can see one reason why the Pharisees put on these burdens in the text today. Jesus says they get overly legalistic about the minor details of the Law but forget the big picture. I love the hyperbolic image here of remembering to strain out a gnat but somehow swallowing a camel instead.\n\nChristianity has always had a complicated relationship with interpreting the Law. It's one of the earliest controversies in the Church, included in the book of Acts and some of the epistles. And there have been many debates with many different answers since then about which laws Christians are supposed to keep and which ones we aren't. It's probably not a coincidence that most of the time, the people making these decisions tend toward rules that help them or scapegoat somebody else, but even then, they typically thought they were doing the right thing.\n\nI once asked some friends about the weirdest thing they've heard condemned in the name of God. I got some depressing answers like \"peace\" and \"education.\" I also got tough to explain answers, like wire rimmed glasses. I assume it's the wire rims that are the problem if it was that specific, not glasses in general. Another mentioned somebody who was being hired by a church and she had to submit some hair for a drug test, but the church thought it was wrong for a woman to cut her hair. After a few weeks of debate, they concluded it would be fine to pluck a hair from her arm instead.\n\nI'm not saying I always understand why the rules are the ways they are, or even that they remember the reason after a couple generations, but there probably was originally a reason.\n\nThe Pharisees were following the Law as they understood it, much like we do today when we fall into similar patterns. I think a big reason is that it's a lot easier to know what you mean to say \"tithe from your harvest\" than it is to say \"seek justice.\" We don't even always agree on what justice looks like, let alone how to best seek it. Working out those details can be helpful. Taking that to the extreme, though, by sticking to the details as a rule while losing track of the big picture reason... that can be very harmful.\n\nOften it happens something like this. We find something that works to connect us with God. It becomes normal, even if not an official rule. Sometimes we forget why we did it in the first place. Often we don't consider if it is stopping other people from being included. You can fill in more of your own examples, but I think of practical things like the way we dress – would someone feel welcome here if they can't afford nice clothes? Or how about the songs we sing? A simple one that happened to me this week had to do with formatting in the bulletin. Emily \\[my wife, who was worship leader the same week\\] asked me if the Call to Worship needed to specify leader and people, and I said, no, people know the default notation of bold meaning the congregation and plain text meaning the leader. I've been in many churches that all used that formatting the same. Fortunately, our pastor caught it and suggested that Emily specify when she announced it. It does not mean these ideas are bad - there's nothing wrong with dressing up for church, or singing familiar songs, or using consistent formatting in the bulletin - but we do sometimes need to stop and analyze the implications.\n\nAgain, we find ourselves in this tension. Most people most of the time are doing what they think is best. Rarely do people consciously make up what they think God says, just so they can exclude other people. Most of the time our motives are more innocent than that. We can't solve this by simply swinging back the other way and say there is no such thing as morality, so instead, we're left with this constant wrestling.\n\n### Closing\n\nI'll close with some wisdom from the Netflix show _The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt_. Obviously the only appropriate way to end a very serious sermon is to quote _The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt_. If you haven't seen it, it's a comedic show where the backstory is that Kimmy spent her teen and young adult years being trapped in a bunker as a part of a doomsday cult. Now she's free and learning how to be a healthy adult in the real world while dealing with the spiritual trauma she experienced. It's one of the funniest shows I've seen in the last few years, but it also has some great moments of insight. One of those moments in the new season has Kimmy saying:\n\n> So, I guess real religion is about knowing we're not perfect but trying to be better... together.\n\nLet's learn from the mistakes of the Pharisees and not be afraid to examine ourselves, not just our motives but also the consequences because they will not always line up neatly. Instead, let's acknowledge that tension and work through it. We know that we are not perfect and we will hurt each other even when we try our best, but we don't give up. We continue to try to be better, together.\n","date":"2017-05-28T10:30:00.000Z"},"/2018/image-invisible-god/":{"id":"/2018/image-invisible-god/","title":"Sermon: The Image of the Invisible God","description":"A sermon about a Mennonite approach to Jesus.","tags":"posts Sermon","content":"\nThe following is my transcript from a recent sermon. It was the third in a series walking through Confession of Faith in a Mennonite Perspective, with this one covering [Article 2: Jesus Christ](http://home.mennonitechurch.ca/cof/art.2). It has only been lightly edited to remove a couple names from our congregation, add an embedded video, and generally change to more web-friendly formatting.\n\n## Intro\n\nA couple of years ago, we had some friends over in our apartment. All of us were Christians, but with a variety of traditions and theological leanings. Somebody asked everybody why they were a Christian. We had been sort of talking about forming a small group together, so it wasn't out of the blue. Remarkably, nobody had the same answer. We heard the philosophical arguments, the historical arguments, their own experiences which they could only attribute to the supernatural. We heard a variant on Pascal's wager, basically that if God exists, you want to be on God's side. We heard somebody acknowledging their brokenness and need for a saviour.\n\nMy answer was that I am a Christian because of Jesus. All those other answers provided that night were probably true for me at some point or another, and they are all still true to some degree or another other than the Pascal's Wager one. I'm not in favour of basing your faith on a starting point involving fear. But ultimately, I am a Christian because the person of Jesus has always continued to be compelling to me. It sounds kind of naïve, I know. I had a youth pastor once who joked that we should just always answer \"God, Jesus, Holy Spirit, Bible\" because one of those was probably the right answer to the simplistic curriculum. But in this case, my real answer was the simple \"Jesus\".\n\nMy feelings about the Church or the Bible have been much more mixed good and bad, but Jesus, Jesus I always continued to be drawn toward.\n\nAt the centre of what drew me to an Anabaptist expression of Christianity was the particular perspective on Jesus. The confession of faith article for today has a lot of big ideas. It talks about Jesus as king, prophet, priest, teacher, saviour, head of the church, Word of God become flesh, Lord, slain Lamb, coming again, sinless, and more.\n\nMost of these things are shared with other groups of Christians, but Anabaptists have a few differences, sometimes just in emphasis and sometimes more significant differences. Because I only have about 20 minutes, I'm focusing on three of these: teacher, king, and the Word of God. Because I guess there's still enough Baptist in me to like 3 point sermons.\n\n## Teacher\n\nOne of the Anabaptist emphases is discipleship, the idea that we are supposed to actually follow Jesus' example and teaching. In an interesting note in the commentary of the confession article, it points out that most Protestants only cite Jesus' roles as king, prophet, and priest, while this one adds teacher as well.\n\nPart of this teaching is the emphasis on peace, which is maybe what Anabaptists are most well known for. It's not only some abstract peace with God after we die, but real practical peace starting now.\n\nIt's interesting to compare what the Mennonite confession of faith says about Jesus' life with what the Nicene Creed or the Apostles Creed say, two of the earliest Christian statements of faith. Both manage to go directly from Jesus being born of a virgin fully human to suffering and dying. They just wipe out everything in between, about 70% of what is recorded in the Gospels. Some Anabaptists have referred to the comma in the Apostles Creed after \"born of a virgin\" as the \"Anabaptist comma\", because there's a lot of stuff that happens in that time which Anabaptists usually consider pretty central.\n\nI found one church online, Emmanuel Mennonite, which had added the following to the comma of the Apostles Creed:\n\n> Welcomed by shepherds,\n> Greeted by Magi,\n> Pursued by Herod,\n> Sheltered in Egypt,\n> Taught by Joseph,\n> Baptized by John,\n> Tempted by Satan,\n> Followed by disciples,\n> Heard by multitudes,\n> Understood by the simple,\n> Despised by clergy,\n> Praised by lepers,\n> Hosted by outcasts,\n> Seen by the blind,\n> Touched by the ill,\n> Rejected by siblings,\n> Rebuked by Martha,\n> Embraced by Mary,\n> Anointed by a prostitute,\n> Cheered by crowds,\n> Loved by John,\n> Hated by the Powers,\n> Abandoned by all,\n> Grieved in Gethsemane,\n> Betrayed by disciples,\n> Denied by Peter,\n> Arrested by Herod.\n\nPhew. That's a pretty significant chunk of the story that gets glossed over in a lot of church traditions and statements.\n\nA couple of years ago Saturday Night Live did a fantastic bit they called DJesus Uncrossed, playing off the release of Django Unchained. They refer to it as the ultimate revenge fantasy, with Jesus coming back to life and exacting vengeance on the Romans who killed him. If you search the Internet for this skit, most of the results will be Christians being upset about it. I thought it was very clever, though, precisely because a lot of people do imagine this is what God is like. They completely overlook everything in between Jesus' birth and death, all those teachings about peace and loving your enemy. That allows them to project anything they want onto the actual character of Jesus. It's no problem that Jesus would go on a revenge fantasy if you do set aside everything Jesus said and did. A lot of people even think that's what Revelation is basically about.\n\n\n\nWhen I said earlier that it is Jesus that ultimately keeps me as a Christian, a big piece of that is the teachings. I am most compelled by Jesus' teachings and miraculous actions. It's more attractive than just some historical or philosophical arguments because seeing these teachings and miracles is what I **want** my God to look like. This is not your typical god of tribalism or nationalism or violence. This is not a god of personal responsibility, every person for themselves, or of individual gain. This is not a god who just offers some happy afterlife with nothing to do in the meantime.\n\nThis was a God who got their hands dirty for the sake of making their love to us clear as well as to empower us to love others. And not just those others who are easy to love. Jesus taught in his context to even love Samaritans, to love Romans who were oppressing them, to love tax collectors who cosied up to those Romans for personal gain, to love prostitutes, to love lepers, and on and on with the people who were often not loved. We could easily map these to marginalized groups within our own society.\n\nImagine what the world would look like if we all lived the kind of things Jesus taught. Even imagine what the world would look like if only those of us who identify as Christians lived these things consistently.\n\n## A Strange Kind of King\n\nThis kind of teaching is important to keep in mind when looking at the next descriptor given to Jesus, that of King.\n\nGod seeks to establish a Kingdom. That much is clear repeatedly throughout the Gospels. In fact, Jesus' most common way to describe his message was that the Kingdom of God was at hand. For many Jews of the time, this would be fantastic news because it meant he was about to lead an armed rebellion against the Romans, restoring the Holy Land - getting their nation back to God, if you will. Even today, that's the way most of us think of the idea of a Kingdom - authoritarian rule over the people of a geographic area by somebody who was either born into power or who took it through violence. We usually imagine a rich guy detached from reality, dictating the rules by which everybody else must live.\n\nSo, there are good reasons why some theologians and pastors are shying away from the language of \"kingdom\". Even the best kings and queens are still fundamentally operating on power over everybody else, and we don't really want to put that image on God.\n\nIf this is the only image of a king we had to work with, that would be a problem to put on God. The same goes with the language of \"Lord\". Both of those are also obviously male terms when we don't believe God is constrained to maleness.\n\nFortunately, Jesus shows us a God who has a very different image of what being a king looks like. This is a king who serves his people, who isn't afraid to get his hands dirty for their benefit. He preaches, teaches, and heals. He proclaims forgiveness of sins and peace. And he doesn't do it by focusing on the rich bureaucracy or religious holy men, ruling from the top down. On the contrary, his focus is on the most outcast in society. If this is a Kingdom, it is the most upside-down and inside-out Kingdom that you could imagine.\n\nI don't think we can completely get rid of the language of Kingship until we have another way to capture this radical claim that yes, God has power, but uses that power in service, not to demand praise or stay detached in Heaven avoiding us. To simply say kinship instead as some have taken to doing erases that God does have authority. It would make it easier to think that God is just like one of us, doing the best they can with limited resources. Contrasting that, the confession puts it that: \"As king who chose the way of the cross, he has revealed the servant character of divine power.\" So, I understand people who say that \"King\" is a bad analogy, but since I don't have a better one, I'll keep using it.\n\nI recently came across a good demonstration of this on the TV show _American Gods_. At the beginning of episode 6 is a fascinating cold open. We see a group of Hispanic people swimming across a river into the United States from Mexico. One of them we see has a tattoo of Jesus - not unusual, since most of South America identifies as Christian. After most have gotten across, one man kneels down, hands up in the air, praying his thanks to God that they made it.\n\nOne man at the back of the group was not a good swimmer, though, and begins to drown. A hand pulls him out and carries him to shore, walking along the water to get there. They have a moment of recognition and it might seem briefly like this will have a happy ending.\n\nBut then the pickup trucks roll up and the guns are pulled out, opening fire on the Hispanic people without any warning. While they scramble for their lives, Jesus steps in front of some, taking the bullets on their behalf before dying. The starkest part, though, was this pair of images: one of the guns has this very nice fancy engraving of the words \"thy kingdom come\" on it. Another shooter casually holds a cross necklace in the same hand as he uses to pull the trigger, murdering people he knows nothing about except that they came from somewhere else. These shooters literally kill Jesus, without knowing it was Jesus, in the name of Jesus.\n\nThey obviously were not trying for subtlety on the show, but this imagery was stuck in my head for the next week. I can't think of any other mainstream TV show or movie that so directly contrasted two completely different understandings of what Jesus' kingdom looks like. For one side, God's Kingdom on Earth means getting rid of the wrong illegal people who would ruin everything. For the others, God's Kingdom is one that brings rescue and perhaps eventually equality regardless of which country they happened to be born in.\n\nThis is an amazing example - not far removed from reality - that demonstrates how much theology does matter. Bad theology can literally kill people. Good theology can literally save lives.\n\n## Son of God, Revelation of God\n\nUltimately, though, the most central claim to make of Jesus is that he is the fullest revelation of God.\n\nThe confession says it this way:\n\n> We acknowledge Jesus Christ as the only Son of God, the Word of God incarnate. He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary. As fully human and tempted as we are, yet without sin, he is the model human being.[12](http://home.mennonitechurch.ca/cof/art.2#refs) As fully divine, he is the one in whom the fullness of God was pleased to dwell. During his earthly life, Jesus had an intimate relationship with his heavenly Abba and taught his disciples to pray \"Abba, Father.\"[13](http://home.mennonitechurch.ca/cof/art.2#refs) He is the image of the invisible God, and \"all things have been created through him and for him, for he is before all things.\"\n\nThat last sentence - Jesus is the image of the invisible God - is a direct biblical quote from Colossians and it is one of those theological ideas that rattled around in my head for years, completely reshaping so much of my theology. There is no bigger question than what God is like, and Jesus answers that question for us. This doesn't dismiss the rest of the Bible, doesn't dismiss church tradition, doesn't dismiss personal experience, but we filter all those things through the revelation of God's fundamental character which we see in Jesus.\n\nAs the sermon said last week, we Anabaptists do have some tendency to overemphasize Jesus at expense of the rest of the Trinity. We might be tempted toward modalism - that is, that Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are just different modes of the same person. Like saying that I am a husband, a website developer, and a podcast editor. Same person, different jobs. I do think we need to avoid this extreme; there are good biblical arguments for maintaining a Trinity. The tweet I added to the slide summed it up well: \"As a Christian, God is defined by Jesus but not confined to Jesus.\" I needed to make that caveat clear before continuing.\n\nThe prelude to the Gospel of John, which Emily read a part of earlier, talks about this from a big philosophical level. The Greek word here is \"logos\", which we typically translate as the \"Word\", but it carries more meaning to it than that. In Greek philosophy, the logos was the principle of divine reason and creative order. We get the word logic from how it is the basis of how things are, in some ways like God identifying themselves to Moses initially as I AM, which the sermon talked about last week. A word is also the fundamental unit of communication, so we could put it another way as \"Jesus is what God has to say\".\n\nFor some, it is a radical concept that God would become incarnate as a human being. They might see a significant conflict between saying that Jesus is both fully human and fully God. But that betrays a lower view of humanity than the Bible and Jesus seemed to hold. Maybe whoever preaches on article 6, the creation and calling of human beings, will cover this, but the starting point for humanity is to be image-bearers of God. Broken image-bearers, but image-bearers nonetheless. So, in a sense, being fully human is to fully be that image of God, which is not a conflict with also being God. It only becomes a problem if we start going down the Greek philosophy emphasis on God being defined primarily by power rather than loving character.\n\nJesus as the image of God becomes a basis for understanding other areas of theology. I'm not going to try to answer some of these other big questions for a couple of reasons. For one, Anabaptists can go in different ways on some of these questions and me going through a lot of my own opinions would counter the point of doing this series on the shared confession of faith. For another, I'm running out of time. But some examples you might ask yourself about:\n\nWhat do we do with the violent portrayals of God in the Bible if God is best seen as this suffering servant like Jesus on the cross?\n\nWhat do we do with the idea of Hell, particularly the eternal conscious torment version of it?\n\nWhat's God's attitude toward marginalized people today: women, LGBTQ, people of colour, the poor, and so on?\n\nEven on things which Jesus didn't directly comment on, we can get a pretty good idea by looking at the kind of things Jesus did and taught and how that reveals God to us.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI will conclude with reading a bit from Jessica Kelley's book _Lord Willing?_. Jessica's son Henry died young of a rare brain disorder and she tells the heart wrenching story in this book. Or you could also hear her speak by searching for more of her work online. We even got her on our MennoNerds podcast once and it was one of my favourites we've done - that's a shameless plug, go find MennoNerds on YouTube. It's not just because of her powerful personal story, but because of her ability to wrestle with heavy theological topics, in this case to do with free will and the problem of evil.\n\nIncluded in the book, she recalls how she played a word association game. When she thought of God, she thought of things like all-powerful, jealous, mighty, judge, wrathful, and ruler. When she thought of Jesus, she thought of things like gentle, loving, miracle worker, and saviour. Not all of those are opposites and much of it could be reconciled together. But it does suggest there's some work to do if you truly believe that Jesus is the full revelation of God while having different character traits than God.\n\nSo I'll end with reading a bit from the introduction of the book, beginning on page 21, asking the question of how we see God:\n\n(At this point I read from _Lord Willing_, but I loaned out that book and never got it back, so I am not able to copy the quote here several years later)\n\nI hope that is a question that we never stop asking.\n","date":"2018-02-04T10:30:00.000Z"},"/2018/beautiful-useful-mess/":{"id":"/2018/beautiful-useful-mess/","title":"A Beautiful Useful Mess (Scripture)","description":"A sermon about a Mennonite approach to Scripture.","tags":"posts Sermon Bible","content":"\nThis is an older sermon from 2018 that I am just now posting in 2025, and I did initially have a slideshow with accompanying photos.

All I could think about at the time was \"crap, I just signed up to talk about the Bible.\" If the confession is embarrassing, just wait until we read what the bible has to say sometimes. And with the confession we can at least always say that it was just humans who wrote it. With the Bible, we’re claiming that all this embarrassing and often extremely problematic content was breathed out by God.\n\nI’m convinced that if somebody simply rewrote books of the Bible in modern language and published it under a different name, most Christian bookstores would refuse to carry it because of all the violence and sex and sometimes swearing. Game of Thrones would be tame in comparison.\n\nWe definitely wouldn’t be marketing that book for kids, like this one, my first Bible, the \"Kid’s Application Bible\". I got this for Christmas when I was 7 from my grandparents. Somebody probably did tell me that I should not start at the beginning like any other book, but I did anyway. I can remember at least getting past Judges so that would have meant a lot of interesting stories. God murders almost the entire world in a flood. God commands a child sacrifice. God turns a woman into salt for daring to look back at her town that God was destroying. God crashes down the walls of Jericho onto all the civilians other than Rahab, the prostitute, and her family who were spared because the Israelite spies decided to, uh, spend the night there before reporting back to Joshua. That’s just the bad stuff attributed to God. There’s also rape, incest, slavery, prostitution, the rest of Israel killing all the men of the tribe of Benjamin, and oh so much more. Introducing kids to the Bible is fantastic and important, and I did get a lot of guidance from my church and family- they didn’t just leave me to figure this out on my own - but we can’t simply pretend all this stuff isn’t there.\n\n### Avoiding Extremes\n\nThe modern Christian Church has tended to fall toward one of two extremes in response to this messiness in the Bible.\n\nOne solution is essentially denial, pretending that those messy parts don’t exist or that they aren’t a problem. For example, they may argue that the genocide of the Canaanites was completely ethical because God said it. Case closed. Ask them about that other part in the Bible when God said to love your enemies and they’ll mostly just shrug, not wanting to think too hard about the contradiction.\n\nOften, this takes it far enough that it idolizes the Bible, treats it as if it was God. I had a professor in seminary who I remember talking about how the Catholic Church tended to functionally replace the Holy Spirit with the institutional Church as if it was the third member of the Trinity. Protestants came along and knocked the Church down a peg, but then put the Bible in that place instead. The Eastern Church has tended to be better on that front, keeping the Holy Spirit in place.\n\nI realize there’s some irony in me saying this. We started out this confession of faith series in the order it is in the confession, going through God and Jesus, then we were supposed to do Holy Spirit before moving on to Scripture. That was the week of the ice storm. So, I’m in the odd place where I have sort of done what I am criticizing, but it was entirely by accident and we will get the Holy Spirit week rescheduled I’m sure.\n\nWhen you treat the Bible as God in this way, it doesn’t take long for \"the Bible\" to be shorthand for \"my tradition’s interpretation of the Bible\", but people don’t realize this, so they just yell at each other and divide because those other people don’t even follow the Bible. This might be the most succinct way to summarize 500 years of Protestant history.\n\nTo quote the biblical scholar NT Wright, the phrase \"authority of Scripture\" only makes sense if by that you mean it is shorthand for the authority of God as exercised through Scripture. Scripture in and of itself is not our authority.\n\n[Another comic](https://churchm.ag/denominations/) demonstrates this perfectly. A teacher is showing a chart of all the divisions branching off each other in church history. They point at the bottom and say \"so this is where our movement came along and finally got the Bible right\" to which the student responds \"Jesus is so lucky to have us.\" I also find it fascinating that this comic refers to getting the Bible right, not to getting Jesus right or God right or Christianity right, which is not far off from language you might see like a \"Bible-believing church.\" You’re already missing the point if you think the goal is to understand the Bible perfectly rather than to follow Jesus.\n\nOn the other end, often labelled as liberal, we could acknowledge the messiness of the Bible and conclude therefore that it is irrelevant. In a lot of popular conversation, this is seen as the only other option. Fundamentalist Christians, liberal Christians, and the more extreme new atheists can agree on this: either read the Bible through that propositional lens, or dismiss it entirely.\n\nIf those really were the only two options, I would be completely in agreement with this liberal perspective. Fortunately, the modern Western way to read the Bible is not our only option.\n\n### Good Messy\n\nAt first glance with our Western lens, a factually-perfect Scripture sounds like it is the highest possible way to think about it. But even if we couldn’t easily poke holes in those factually-messy and ethically-messy parts, this perspective has a bigger problem: it strips out any relationality.\n\nThe Bible is messy, but we believe in a messy God, a God who still sees so much value in the broken and flawed. This is a God who cares more about relating to us than about factual perfection, and that shines through when we allow the Bible to be the complicated mess that it is. To me, that is a higher view of Scripture, so much more beautiful than an abstract rulebook.\n\nAnother way to frame this is that the Bible is the wrestling mat with God. This phrase goes back to the foundational story when Jacob is given the name Israel after wrestling with God – or possibly an angel, again the Bible isn’t always concerned with factual detail. The name Israel means one who wrestles with God. If we are to be the ones who follow in those spiritual footsteps, we must be willing to wrestle with God as well. The Bible is often a place we can encounter God and do that wrestling.\n\nHere’s one of my favourite examples from Proverbs 26:4-5. In back to back verses, we have completely opposite advice. Don’t answer a fool according to his folly because if you do, you sink to that level. Do answer a fool according to his folly because if not, he’ll think he’s wise. I’ve seen the modern version of this exact debate play out a lot in the past couple of years. If a certain prominent politician repeatedly lies, what should journalists do about it? Is it their job to call out every lie no matter what, or does that just feed the narrative that mass media is fake news? Or do they ignore it, and risk the lies getting even more out of hand? I think in sticking this conflicting advice beside each other, it was like an ancient way for the author to say, \"well, it depends, it’s complicated.\" That might frustrate you if you are looking for a rule book to answer every question about life, but if you are looking for a ground to wrestle with God about questions like this, it’s reassuring that you aren’t alone in trying to navigate these things.\n\nThe other reading today from 2 Timothy says that the Bible is God-breathed and I’ve heard many sermons about this part. Some translations just say \"inspired\" but \"God-breathed\" is a more direct translation of the Greek text. It’s often used to argue that the Bible is perfect in the modern propositional fact sense, since God is perfect and God wouldn’t breathe something imperfect. But there’s another thing the Bible says has been breathed by God: us, humanity. The Bible describes itself with the same language it describes us: messy, flawed, but still a place we can see God.\n\n### Using the Bible\n\nWithin the context, the author of 2 Timothy seems more concerned with the claim that the Bible is useful, though. It is not an extravagant claim of precisely how much was God involved in getting the Bible to how it is today. Some of those questions are interesting to talk about and do have implications for how we interpret what we read in the Bible, but the main priority of the biblical authors seemed to be that we use it in ways that help us follow Jesus better.\n\n### The Jesus Lens\n\nSo on that note, if we were talking how to use this book that is useful, the first thing we have to say is Jesus. Jesus is always a good answer. I had a youth pastor who joked that most of the pre-written questions for kids could be answered with one of \"God, Jesus, Holy Spirit, Bible.\" With Anabaptists that’s especially true with Jesus.\n\nThe modern framework in most biblical studies classes will emphasize getting as close as we can to understanding the intention of the author in their context. This is a noble and useful thing. But the Bible writers don’t even use their own Scriptures in this way. They repeatedly take some very creative liberties with their sacred texts, twisting things all over the place to make something which clearly meant something else to the original author to now be about Jesus. For a long time, I used those Bibles which had footnotes where the author was quoting or citing a previous text. Like most people I imagine, I never went back and read the context of those original texts. I just assumed that if it was in the Bible, it was all completely consistent. And from their perspective it was all consistent, just not from a modern perspective.\n\nOne of many examples: Matthew quotes Hosea about God calling his son out of Egypt. In Hosea it is very clear that is referring to the nation of Israel in the Exodus story, while Matthew spins it to be about Jesus as a child refugee. This was not a conflict for Matthew.\n\nJesus gives them and us permission to do this. He says things like \"you search the Scriptures because you think that in them you’ll find eternal life, but they point to me\" in John 5 and that he fulfills the Scriptures in the Sermon on the Mount. Jesus seems to think that we are supposed to read the Bible looking for him.\n\nOh, and even Jesus did this twisting with his own teaching. In Luke 4, when he launches his ministry, he reads from Isaiah. He says:\n\n\"The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favour.\"\n\nThen he rolled up the scroll and stopped. If you look up the reference in Isaiah, he stopped partway through a sentence. The next line is \"and the day of vengeance of our God.\" His listeners are longing for somebody to come along and get rid of their Roman oppressors with that day of God’s vengeance. That would be the good part they were looking forward to hearing preached. And Jesus just cuts that part out. He twists Scripture out of its obvious context to point us toward a better picture of the heart of God.\n\nUnderstanding the original context and intent of the author is good and helpful to better understand the text, so I don’t want to come across too harsh as slandering modern biblical studies. But it is not the end goal. We do not have to say that the only value in a text is whatever the author originally meant. If we believe that Jesus is the ultimate revelation of God – which goes back to last time I preached – then it makes sense that the Bible would point us back toward him.\n\nThis isn’t a pointing in some legalistic or literal way. We don’t have to pretend that every verse void of context is actually about Jesus. Rather, Jesus is the culmination of the story of the Bible. Some would read the Bible as if it were flat – all texts being equal – but that’s not how a story works. If you watch a movie with a great twist ending, it is going to force you to reinterpret everything that came before it. The classic example is the Sixth Sense. You can’t learn at the end that Bruce Willis was dead the whole time, then still insist that he was alive for most of it. It’s an old movie; I do not need to give a spoiler warning for that. You didn’t know he was dead the whole time, but now you do. In the same way, now we know how the story builds through Israel to Jesus and the Church, so we can’t just go back to pretending otherwise.\n\n### Community\n\nHow to do this Jesus lens isn’t always obvious, of course. It is easy to all have our own image of Jesus and then twist the rest of Scripture to fit that image.\n\nOne important check against this is a community hermeneutic, simply meaning that we read Scripture together. I sometimes think I’m pretty knowledgeable about the Bible. After all, I have a Master of Divinity, which has to be the most arrogant sounding degree possible. If I’m a master of God, what can mere mortals teach me about the Bible? Well, turns out, there’s a lot.\n\nThe 2 Timothy text even hints at this a bit, which I hadn’t noticed before now, when it says: \"because you know those from whom you learned it\". The author doesn’t expect Timothy to just accept this because it was in an important magical book, but because it came out of learning together in relationship.\n\n![The Cross and the Lynching Tree by James Cone](./The-Cross-and-the-Lynching-Tree.jpg)\n\nCommunity in general doesn’t go far enough, though. That same professor I mentioned earlier had another line I often think about. She pointed out that if we just say \"theology\", we are talking about straight, white, European or European-descended, men. Probably German but sometimes American, and usually Protestant. Everything else gets an adjective. Black theology. Feminist theology. Womanist theology. And so on. This is a simple way that we might allow marginalized groups to speak on theology, but we also make sure it is clear that the real objective theology is when people like me do it.\n\nSo, especially if you are somebody like me who has a relatively high amount of privilege, it is absolutely vital that we learn to listen to those who don’t. There are obviously lots of reasons to do this simply in terms of being able to love our neighbours better, but it’s also true that we’re going to miss a lot of the Bible if we don’t.\n\nA simple example is the story of Junia. In Romans 16:7, Paul refers to Junia as prominent among the apostles. After a couple of centuries, manuscripts began changing the name from Junia – a woman’s name – to Junias, a man’s name. It was likely not an intentional conspiracy to get rid of Junia, but by the 3rd century there were few women in leadership in the church. These male manuscript copiers probably assumed that their manuscripts had a simple error and so they went ahead and fixed it. Most translations have now fixed this back, but to this day we still have some printing the incorrect Junias.\n\nAnother example would be the Exodus story. Growing up, the primary point of the story always came across to me as how much more powerful God is than the gods of Egypt. That’s in there. But the thrust of the story is that God heard the cries of an oppressed people and came to their rescue.\n\nThe Bible was written by a tiny nation spending most of its time under the oppressive boot of one Empire or another: Egypt, Assyria, Persia, Greece, Rome. If I read the Bible by myself, I share a lot more in common with these Empires than I do with any of the biblical writers.  If only people like me did theology and biblical studies, it would become very easy for me to not even notice the ways that the Bible opposes these Empires and empowers women and cares for the poor and so on. Here’s another one of my Bibles: the Poverty and Justice Bible, which highlights texts that have to do with poverty and social justice. It really helps make it obvious when a significant portion of the text is highlighted, but still I would need some of those other voices to help me grasp what is going on.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n[One of my favourite comics, XKCD, recently released this one](https://xkcd.com/1984/). One person is sitting at a computer and says \"Ugh, people are mad at me again because they don’t read carefully. I’m being perfectly clear, it’s not my fault if everyone misinterprets what I say.\" Another person outside of the frame responds, \"Wow, sounds like you’re great at communicating, an activity that famously involves just one person.\" Communication is messy, even when it is between two human beings who share a lot in common, let alone from God to us.\n\nThe Bible is messy and it isn’t always easy to figure out how to read it in a healthy way. But my hope is that we can embrace that beautiful mess and use it, together in community and always with an eye toward Jesus.\n","date":"2018-05-06T10:30:00.000Z"},"/2019/jesus-break-wheel/":{"id":"/2019/jesus-break-wheel/","title":"Jesus Break the Wheel","description":"A sermon for Peace Sunday about Revelation.

These texts are filled with violent imagery of swords and armies and blood flowing. This kind of imagery might be uncomfortable for a lot of people and I can understand why.\n\nFor me, though, this kind of violence wrapped up in fantastical imagery isn’t a big deal. I grew up with TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I’ve always been drawn to media that wrestled with the idea that there was more to life than the obvious physical world we can see. They were big stories of good vs evil. They had a small group of humans at the centre of the story, but you knew their actions were a part of something so much bigger. Their decisions had consequences on this cosmic battle even when a lot of others around them went on with their normal lives oblivious that anything else was going on.\n\nAs a kid watching Buffy, it never crossed my mind to go out and stab people with pieces of wood the way she would stake a vampire. I think it’s completely missing the point when people read Revelation and think it encourages violence. In other words, violent imagery is not the same thing as promoting violence.\n\nRevelation is a part of a genre that we call apocalyptic. Like Buffy, this type of literature is marked by fantastical imagery of the battle between good and evil. The apocalypse genre did go a step further than shows like Buffy, though.\n\nWhen we say the apocalypse genre, we do not mean some futuristic end of the world scenario. The Greek root of the word apocalypse is an unveiling. It is a pulling back of the curtain to show us what’s really going on in the world that we can’t normally see. In some translations of the Bible, you will still see the word apocalypse in the title for this last book, but in English we usually translate to a revelation.\n\n### Revelation of What?\n\nIf it is a revelation, what is it trying to reveal to us?\n\n[Kurt Willems](https://www.kurtwillems.com/) provides this summary. The last book of the Bible is a revelation:\n\n- Of Jesus\n- To John\n- For the Church\n- Against the Empire\n- During the first century\n\nWe don’t have time to unpack all those components. You can look up more of Kurt’s work if you are interested in more about it. The big two I want to focus on here are “of Jesus” and “against the Empire” because putting the two together you really see how the message of Jesus and the message of Empire are at odds with each other, how there is this battle between them.\n\nWhat do I mean by Empire? At the simplest level we could say the power of a political or military state to enforce the will of those on the top against those with less power. I think we can push a bit farther than that, though, and say that it is any systemic evil maintaining social hierarchies. Whether physical violence is used is not the determining factor in my opinion.\n\n### Against the Empire\n\nIt’s noteworthy in this Revelation text that Jesus comes to strike down the nations. He does not come to strike down select individual people who did the wrong things or believed the wrong theology. It is the political and military order that stands in opposition to Jesus, not the general population.\n\nRevelation is against the empire on two levels. It is against the Roman Empire specifically. And it is against the concept of Empire more generally.\n\nThere is some debate about when Revelation was written. What we can say for sure is that it is within a context of being persecuted by a powerful and violent Roman Empire. The immediate goal of Revelation is to teach and encourage Christians to stand strong during this persecution.\n\nAt the beginning of the book, John names several churches who are the recipients of the letter. There is a common thread between these churches: they were all in cities that hosted a temple of the Roman civil religion. That probably isn’t a coincidence. There’s something about religion empowering Empire which was important for John to challenge. And then throughout the rest of the letter, John sets up a basic framework: there is a cosmic conflict between God and Satan. This battle is being fought on the ground by the church vs the empire.\n\nThis message is a radical one. The ways of Empire are fundamentally opposed to the ways of God.\n\nJewish people – and at this point most of the Church was Jewish – were well familiar with Empire. The foundational story of Israel was the escape from being slaves in the Egyptian Empire. After a brief period of autonomy, they traded being controlled by one empire after another. Assyrian. Babylonian. Greek. A couple of smaller fragments of the Greek Empire after it split up. And Roman.\n\n### The Wheel\n\nIn a more recent fantasy TV show, Game of Thrones, Daenarys also takes notice of the cycles of Empire similar to the one that happens over the course of the Bible. In one defining scene, she is asked about her quest to rule and why that makes her any different than the rest of the noble houses. She responds like this:\n\n> They’re all just spokes on a wheel. This one’s on top, then that one’s on top. And on and on it spins, crushing those on the ground… I’m not going to stop the wheel. I’m going to break the wheel.\n\nShe was right in how she diagnosed the problem. The wheel of Empire does keep spinning and it does keep crushing those on the ground.\n\nShe was wrong about how to break the wheel, though. She subscribed to a similar idea as the Roman Empire did, and to be honest, what most people believe most of the time. It was even a common phrase with Rome: the Pax Romana or Roman Peace. This is the philosophy of peace through strength, that we can create peace by violently stopping any opposition. If we can either wipe out the bad people or at least keep them under our control, they can’t hurt us. This often works for many years at a time, but empires always fall. The wheel keeps spinning with somebody else on top, still crushing the people on the ground. What Daenarys couldn’t grasp was that her rationale was not that different from many of the other noble houses. Most of them thought they were doing what was necessary to create peace, under their leadership instead.\n\nOur modern equivalent of the wheel – of Empire - is more complicated than in the time of the biblical authors or in Game of Thrones. It isn’t quite as simple as a clear-cut political entity with a large army killing or imprisoning everybody who gets in the way. Our Empires are often built more on economics and social hierarchies, not going to direct violence unless that fails. But it’s the same idea of systemic evils keeping a few on top and most being crushed underneath.\n\n### Jesus vs the Wheel\n\nSo against this idea of Empire, Jesus shows up in Revelation 19 to the start of the battle already covered in blood. But if the battle hasn’t started yet, whose blood is it? The consistent answer within the New Testament is that it is his own blood. Jesus already won the battle through his own sacrifice. The original audience of this letter, the churches, would be familiar with this theme. There’s no indication that this is meant to be the blood of his enemies who he has already slaughtered even though the fight hasn’t started yet.\n\nJesus also has a sword, coming out of his mouth. That’s a weapon, clearly. But coming out of his mouth is not very effective if the goal is to attack somebody with it.\n\nImagine trying to stab somebody with a sword from your mouth. The imagery of his mouth suggests the same as we see in the Ephesians text. There it equates the Word of God to a sword. To the original readers of Revelation, the language of a sword coming from Jesus’ mouth would not have suggested physical violence. It would have suggested the power of Jesus’ life and teachings to confront evil.\n\nCertainly, there is violent imagery around this picture of Jesus. But there is not a good reason to believe that it is meant to convey any literal violence committed by Jesus against people. I believe this vision is completely consistent with the Jesus we understand from the Gospels, the one who taught us things like loving our enemies. It’s just a different genre and requires remembering some of what we already know about Jesus.\n\nThis is probably why Anabaptists like to preach from the Sermon on the Mount so much. If there’s such a thing as a constitution of the Kingdom of God, then the Sermon on the Mount is probably the most succinct version. While the Empire runs on the philosophy of peace through conquest, Jesus’ Kingdom runs on the philosophy of peace through justice. Revelation says that victory comes through Jesus’ life and teachings, but we still need to have those teachings in mind as a starting point to understand how that works.\n\nA key distinction is what we read from Ephesians today. Our battle is not against flesh and blood. Instead, it’s against the powers and principalities. You can interpret these powers and principalities to mean demonic forces, human systemic forces, or both. In any case, it is essential to remember that it is this wheel, or this mindset of Empire, that we are in conflict with. We are not doing battle with the people who are caught up in that system, even if they seem to benefit and reinforce it.\nI found the sermon last week fascinating on how it ties into here. In looking at the story of Daniel and the lion’s den, the preacher sympathized with the position of King Darius. He held more power than anybody else in all the Empire. And yet, even he got caught up in the wheel and felt like he couldn’t do what he really wanted to do to spare Daniel’s life.\n\nAnd as she talked about, that should give us hope because we are often the ones on the side of Empire whether we realize it or not.\n\nSamantha Field is one of my favourite bloggers. She wrote recently about her experience protesting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the U.S. She quotes from Brene Brown saying this:\n\n> However seductive the machine metaphor may be for industrial production, human organizations are not actually mechanisms and people are not components in them. People have values and feelings, perceptions, opinion, motivations, and biographies, whereas cogs and sprockets do not. An organization is not the physical facilities within which it operates; it is the networks of people in it.\n\nThese protestors including Samantha were arrested and locked up for 12 hours without food or water for their non-violent protests. She says that one of the officers arresting her asked \"why did you make me do this?\" and she was initially confused because she did not make him do anything. She then explained this, looking back on it:\n\n> They view themselves as just a part of the system, just doing their jobs. It’s not up to them what happens, they’re just \"enforcing the law,\" they don’t set policy they just enact it … but the reality is that they’re not just wheels grinding away in a machine. They’re people, and they have choices about what they do.\n\nBut how do you help them realize that they do have a choice? She also quotes Walter Wink saying this:\n\n> You point out to them where they are abusing you or the situation and you open them to the opportunity to learn and change and grow.\n\nOne of the ways to demonstrate that is from the Sermon on the Mount where Jesus talks about going the extra mile with a Roman soldier. It is tempting without knowing any of the context to think this is encouraging you to be passive about doing whatever authority tells you. But it’s more complicated than that.\n\nA Roman soldier was legally entitled to force a citizen to carry his equipment for one mile, but that’s it. Anything more than that, the soldier would get in trouble. If you were to insist on carrying for an extra mile, that would put the soldier in a very tough position. By voluntarily offering that extra mile, it asserts your humanity and ability to make that choice.\n\nThe soldier would likely know that he was only entitled to one mile and try to stop you from giving an extra mile. You can imagine a scenario where you and this soldier are fighting in the middle of the town about whether to keep going. If you really are an equal human capable of making that decision, it draws public attention to the fact that even the first mile is unfair. That soldier is stuck choosing between whether to continue to dehumanize citizens or to get out of the harmful system.\n\nThat rule of carrying equipment an extra mile doesn’t make any sense in our context. But the principle does. A modern equivalent may be like those ICE protestors who got arrested. Maybe that officer who spoke to Samantha went home and realized that he does have a choice. He does not have to keep doing this. He is not a cog in the wheel. He is a human who could do something different.\n\nIn other words, one of the primary goals in non-violent resistance is to reveal the humanity not only in the person who is oppressed but also in the person who is doing the oppression. It asserts that the person being oppressed is fully human and should not be treated this way. And in doing that, it shows those people doing the oppressing that they have a choice to turn away from the ways of Empire. It jars them out of \"just doing my job.\"\n\nThis is essential in understanding the difference between the Empire’s peace through victory and Jesus’ peace through restorative justice. The peace of Jesus does not wipe out its enemies. It loves its enemies, with the goal of making them no longer enemies.\n\n### The Necessity of Hope\n\nTo me the biggest question in theology is what God is like. For example, is God truly love? Does God really care about oppression?\n\nThe second biggest question to me is: what’s the point of all of this? What are we moving toward?\n\nThis is the question of eschatology. The word eschatology just means the end goal, the kind of world that we are building toward. A healthy eschatology helps you see beyond yourself. If you believe in the Kingdom that Jesus taught and modelled for us, that should be a hopeful thing. It is not simply Jesus spinning the wheel and putting somebody else in charge who will do the same things, like most of human history. It is Jesus breaking the wheel. The Kingdom of God does not operate on the same terms as Empire. The Kingdom of God loves enemies and actively seeks to free everyone from oppression, both those being oppressed and those doing the oppressing.\n\nOn the surface, it’s easy to see these texts like Revelation as less hopeful than other simpler passages about peace and love. But I find it much more hopeful. It acknowledges the realities of systemic evils. It is not a naïve feel-good sentimentality. It is a message that steps back and reveals that we are all a part of a big picture. Your day-to-day decisions might seem insignificant, but we are all a part of this battle over what kind of a world we are building. Do we keep spinning the wheel, perpetuating injustice? Or do we choose to fight back by loving our enemies? Do we choose the true peace through justice that Jesus taught and lived, or do we settle for the pretend peace through victory?\n\nThe world is complicated and we are all probably both oppressors and oppressed in some ways. In some ways you are probably fighting against the ways of Empire with everything you have. If so, there is hope in Jesus breaking the wheel, saving you from being crushed. In other ways you are probably propping up these systemic evils, intentionally or not. There is hope in Jesus breaking the wheel there too, helping you see the humanity in those you are crushing and calling you toward a better way.\n\nWhen we say things in church like \"the peace of Christ be with you,\" it is this kind of peace that we pray for and work towards. We do not seek simply an absence of conflict. We seek a world that is made whole with justice.\n","date":"2019-11-10T10:30:00.000Z"},"/2020/magnificat-hope/":{"id":"/2020/magnificat-hope/","title":"Magnificat Hope","description":"Advent, Mary, and eschatological liberatory hope.","tags":"posts Sermon Politics","content":"\n## Scripture\n\n[Luke 1:46-55](https://bibles.org/bible/1fd99b0d5841e19b-02/LUK.1?passageId=LUK.1.46-LUK.1.55&q=luke%201%3A46-55)\n\n[Philippians 4:1-9](https://bibles.org/bible/1fd99b0d5841e19b-02/PHP.4?passageId=PHP.4.1-PHP.4.9&q=Philippians%204%3A1-9)\n\n## Video\n\nVideo from YouTube is available below:\n\n\n\n## Transcript\n\nThe Gospel text today is a common part of the story in Advent leading up to Christmas. Mary has just found out she's a pregnant virgin, goes to visit her cousin Elizabeth, and then breaks out into song. I'm always amazed by this reaction. Most people finding out about an unwanted pregnancy as a teenager or young adult do not respond by singing a song about God's liberation. And that's not even factoring in the whole virginity thing. Before the reading today, Mary does ask how that is going to work, but then at least as far as Luke tells it, she moves quickly to celebrating.\n\nThat always makes me wonder how many women God pitched this idea to before finding one that said yes. Maybe God had been trying to do this whole incarnation thing for decades and hadn't gotten somebody to agree to it yet. In the Eastern Church, Mary is called the Theotokos, which means mother of God. I'm not going to pick apart the theological implications of that; I just like it because it makes her sound like a superhero, and I do think what little we learn of Mary is pretty heroic.\n\nAnyway, Mary does not run away. Instead, she agrees, and delivers this song we call the Magnificat. That label has nothing to do with magnificent cats, which is what I always think of when I hear the word.\n\n![\"Green t-shirt with a magnificent looking cat, wearing sunglasses and dancing, and the word Magnificat underneath\"](./magnificat.png)\n\nThe name comes from the word magnify, from the first line that sometimes gets translated as \"my soul magnifies the Lord.” This song is Mary's way of amplifying what she believes is the core message of God. So what does Mary think is of central importance to God?\n\n> Holy is his name.\n> He shows mercy to everyone, from one generation to the next, who honors him as God.\n> He has shown strength with his arm. He has scattered those with arrogant thoughts and proud inclinations.\n> He has pulled the powerful down from their thrones and lifted up the lowly.\n> He has filled the hungry with good things and sent the rich away empty-handed.\n> (Luke 1:49b-53 CEB)\n\nIt is a song of hope. It's not a fluffy hope. It's not a romantic Hallmark movie song about getting married and having a baby. Neither is it depressed giving up because of how hard this will be for her, and it will be hard for her.\n\nWe're almost at the end of 2020. There's a pretty strong consensus that it has been a rough year, and I don't even know what other bad news might come through between me recording this Tuesday night and you watching it Sunday morning or later. In the middle of these challenging times, I've found myself thinking a lot about how important hope is, and what the Christian tradition has to say about the idea of hope.\n\nHope is something that has felt to be in short supply in our world, especially in the past few years. I don't think of myself as feeling hopeful very often. At best I'm just trying to get through one day at a time. If I do think about the future, it can be hard to be optimistic.\n\nBut on the first day of Advent, Pope Francis tweeted this:\n\n> #Advent is a continuous call to hope: it reminds us that God is present in history to lead it to its ultimate goal and to its fullness, which is the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nI saw that and thought it basically summarized my homily for today and summarized the Gospel text today.\n\n### What is Christian hope?\n\nThe Magnificat is a song of hope, and it is a song of judgement. The two ideas go together. You can't really have hope without justice.\n\nMary's not the first to express hope in God's justice. Mary is clearly steeped in the Hebrew Scriptures and community that came before her. She even says that in the song – these hopes have been passed down for generations. Throughout the Hebrew prophets, this is sometimes called the Day of the Lord, when God would come and make everything right.\n\nThere will be a judgement, they believed, and this will be a good thing. We often think of judgement in terms of punishment, but that's the wrong framework. When we talk about God's judgement, we are talking about restoration. It is a vision of healing. It is fundamentally an act of God's love.\n\nThis God steps into history. This God identifies things wrong with the world, like wealth and power inequities, and then does something about them. That means lifting up those on the bottom of our power structures, but it also means knocking down those on the top.\n\nSometimes these prophetic visions of the future are downright threatening. It will be uncomfortable, even painful, for those benefitting from the inequities of the world. And we do all need to ask ourselves in what ways are we the powerful that will need to be cast down. For example, our congregation is mostly white. Most of us have benefitted greatly from systemic realities that make our lives consistently a bit easier. In line with Mary and the other prophets, I can say that white supremacy will be cast down from its throne on our world. There's no room for that kind of inequity in the judgement of God. As much as it can be painful for those of us learning to let go of our privileges, this is a beautiful hopeful thing to be liberated from the ways that we oppress others as well as the ways that we are oppressed by others.\n\nThis hope is also fundamentally physical. The prophetic visions of future hope are always in terms of justice on this planet. This world matters. Our bodies matter. Our social interactions and systems matter.\n\nN.T. Wright put it this way in his book Surprised by Hope:\n\n> The word eschatology, which literally means \"the study of the last things,” doesn't just refer to death, judgment, heaven, and hell, as used to be thought (and as many dictionaries still define the word). It also refers to the strongly held belief of most first-century Jews, and virtually all early Christians, that history was going somewhere under the guidance of God and that where it was going was toward God's new world of justice, healing, and hope. The transition from the present world to the new one would be a matter not of the destruction of the present space-time universe but of its radical healing… We mean, rather, the entire sense of God's future for the world and the belief that that future has already begun to come forward to meet us in the present.\n> _Surprised by Hope_ chapter 7\n\n### Grounded in Hope\n\nSo if that's what we mean by a Christian hope, how do we live in light of that? What does it look like to be grounded in this hope of a new world?\n\nThis ties into the Philippians text we also read today. In this text, Paul encourages his readers to focus on what is good. It is absolutely necessary to talk about what is wrong with the world. If we don't acknowledge things like the structural racism built into our daily lives so much that we don't usually think about it, then we'll never be able to do anything to dismantle it. But being angry at the injustices of the world only gets us so far.\n\nWhen I was a Cabin Leader at a summer camp several years ago, one of the things I remember was in our training about leading programs teaching skills to the kids. The camp director said that at least 90% of the feedback we give needs to be positive, what the kids were getting right. Then you can sprinkle in a little bit of things that they were doing wrong. The basis is what's good. The priority is helping them visualize doing it right.\n\nAlong these lines, I recently came across a devotional called \"Imagination: the Most Underrated Spiritual Discipline” which I accessed through the Our Bible app. The author, Laura Jean Truman, said this:\n\n> Without hope, we can burn out.\n> Prophets have been yelling about injustice for years, but they've also been preaching about the Beloved Community, the High Country, the Kingdom of God, shalom. We sometimes feel like that part of prophetic ministry – the ministry of future hope – isn't as important as the dismantling of the structures of evil. But the imaginative painting of the world we're aiming for is just as important as naming what is broken in this one. The world needs your imagination. The world needs your creativity. The world needs you to tell a better story… about the future.\n> …\n> Promises of beauty can tear apart what's ugly.\n> from Laura Jean Truman, in devotional \"Imagination: the Most Underrated Spiritual Discipline” in Our Bible App\n\nThis has some neurological basis to it as well. A central rule of understanding the human brain is Hebbian learning, which can be summarized as: \"neurons that fire together, wire together.” The more that we have a certain negative thought pattern, the more we reinforce that negative thought pattern, and we'll go back to that even more easily next time. The more that we have a certain positive thought pattern, the more we reinforce that, and we'll go back to that even more easily next time.\n\nIn other words, hope is a choice, a discipline, not just a feeling.\n\nAnd I'll be honest: it's not a discipline I'm good at. This homily started with 90% raging against injustices of the world and pulling out lots of biblical texts to back me up. Then I read that devotional, started writing this section, realized how much I needed this message for myself, and started cutting back the rage.\n\nWe need to be able to hope for a good future. We need to be able to think on what is good. We need to be able to imagine things like living in a world with racial equity. We need to be able to imagine what it would look like if the church was providing an early taste of that Kingdom reality, if we were a community where people of colour were fully included and fully equal in every way. We need to be able to imagine if that equity emanated out from us so much that people were energized by the hopeful vision of a better world that they see.\n\nN.T. Wright again in Surprised by Hope said this:\n\n> Hope is what you get when you suddenly realize that a different worldview is possible, a worldview in which the rich, the powerful, and the unscrupulous do not after all have the last word. The same worldview shift that is demanded by the resurrection of Jesus is the shift that will enable us to transform the world.\n> from _Surprised by Hope_, chapter 4\n\nAdvent is a season of waiting, but it isn't just waiting for the sake of waiting. It is a waiting hopefully for the Kingdom of God. As we say when we light the candle every week, we wait in darkness, o lord, for the coming of your light. My hope for this Advent is that we are able to spend some time dreaming about the Kingdom of God, to have our worldview shift, to be a bit more like Mary.\n\nWrapping up, I'd like to suggest taking a couple of minutes just to try this. I'll leave about 30 seconds of just the fireplace on when I'm done, but feel free to pause it and spend longer before continuing to the next part of the worship service.\n\nAllow yourself to daydream a little. Allow yourself to imagine something that makes you feel hopeful. If you have to, start with something negative, but don't stay there. Move on to imagining what it would be like to no longer have that problem. It can be something in your personal life or something broader in society, like the racial equity example I've been using. Allow yourself to soak in that vision of a better world. It might feel silly at first, but the more you try it, the more you can slowly start to align your brain toward that hopeful vision.. And that will help fuel you to put that vision into practice, empower you to join with Jesus in transforming the world.\n\nI'll end with the words of Beth Carlson-Malena in a recent newsletter for [Generous Space](https://www.generousspace.ca/), a ministry focused on LGBTQ inclusion in the church:\n\n> This hope is dangerous.\n> It shows up when we're not expecting it.\n> It's born right in the middle of our mess.\n> And it's all we've got.\n","date":"2020-12-13T10:30:00.000Z"},"/2021/many-tongues/":{"id":"/2021/many-tongues/","title":"The Many Tongues of the Kingdom","description":"A sermon about Pentecost and the beauty of diversity.","tags":"posts Sermon Politics","content":"\n## Scripture Texts\n\n[Tower of Babel: Genesis 11:1-9](https://bibles.org/bible/1fd99b0d5841e19b-02/GEN.11?passageId=GEN.11.1-GEN.11.9&q=genesis%2011%3A1-9)\n\n[Pentecost: Acts 2:1-21](https://bibles.org/bible/1fd99b0d5841e19b-02/ACT.2?passageId=ACT.2.1-ACT.2.10&q=acts%202%3A1-21)\n\n## Transcript\n\nFor anybody who doesn’t know me, I’m Ryan Robinson and I’m a bit of a language nerd. I don’t actually speak any languages other than English, but I do always like learning about language. I’m also a theology and Bible nerd. It makes sense that today’s Scripture passages are fascinating to me. It also makes sense that I was excited when I recently saw [this comic from XKCD](https://xkcd.com/2421/) that hit on that same combination.\n\nIn this version of the Babel story, after the humans have built a tower to God, God congratulates them for their achievement. God asks them what they would like as a reward. One of the group says that words are really cool. God quickly grants them lots of languages to study before the rest of the group can express regretting that they brought a linguist with them. That’s kind of how I feel thinking about the Tower of Babel story. I think it’s kind of cool that we have all these languages with some similarities but also lots of differences to explore.\n\nI’m not saying that XKCD is equivalent to biblical canon, but I do think there’s something to be said for reading the Babel story with the idea that lots of languages is a good thing, not a punishment.\n\n### Babel\n\nThe story of the Tower of Babel is early in our Bibles. It’s part of the book of Genesis' \"pre-history,\" the stories that are clearly more mythological in nature, not tied to any literal history.\n\nIt is placed in the biblical story after that of Noah and before Abraham. I think this whole chunk of Genesis pre-history, from chapters 3 through 11, is best understood as the story of human evil – or sin if we want to use a religious word – spreading across the world. The world is just getting more and more violent. The Darren Aronofsky Noah movie from a few years ago starts with this, with some imagery of the darkness spreading across the earth.\n\nGod tries to get it under control again with a flood, but that doesn’t help for long. The Noah story ends with him getting drunk, passing out in a field, and cursing one of his sons. The Scripture narrative continues with human evil getting out of control again, until it builds up to the Tower of Babel. That might seem like an overstatement reading it out of context in English. Modern readers often boil it down to a story of human hubris and God punishing that. God doesn’t like tall buildings, or something like that.\n\nBut there are a few important symbols in this story that I think make it more than just a tale of hubris. The most obvious: Babel sounds a lot like Babylon. The general scholarly consensus is that this was written around the time of the Babylonian Exile. Israel had been conquered by Babylon and scattered all over their Empire. It is important to remember that the original readers did not hear Babel and think of building big cities. Babel was the oppressive Empire who uses violence to get what they want and sees some lives as more valuable than others.\n\nAnother of the trademarks of the Babylonian Empire was building ziggurats – these big towers with steps up the side. So a Tower of Babel would be something that Israelites literally saw regularly reminding of their oppression.\n\nA third symbol is the bricks. A tower made of bricks is not a neutral term. There's a parallel in Exodus, where we hear that the enslaved Hebrews (they weren't called Israelites at that point) were forced to make bricks for Egypt. The story of Babel comes before that in our Bibles now, but the story of the Exodus likely existed much earlier. That’s the most foundational story of Hebrew identity. While the Tower and the name Babel references the current Empire for them, the bricks also call back to a previous violent Empire they were enslaved by. Importantly, they escaped that Empire with God’s help. That is a subtle reminder already in the story that there is hope in the face of this Empire because God is a God of liberation.\n\nMost of this is lost without context in an English translation. We can easily be mistaken to think that everybody was happily working together equally to build this tower. But digging a little deeper and that doesn't hold up. It is probably meant to convey that the Tower was being built on the backs of slaves or otherwise exploited people for the benefit of the ruling class.\n\nSo, if this is really about the exploitative nature of Empire, not simply hubris, that changes how we see God’s response. Unlike the story of Noah, God doesn’t try to solve the problem with violence. Instead, God solves the problem by introducing diversity, specifically, a diversity of language. The Empire's violence could no longer hold up in the face of this diversity and the people scatter all over the world, many of them scattering to their freedom.\n\n### Pentecost\n\nFast forward about 600 years after the Babylonian Exile. If you’ve been around churches long enough, you may have heard the idea that the story of Pentecost in Acts 2 is a \"reversal of Babel.\" I contend that this statement is half true. The Holy Spirit descends and people are suddenly able to speak languages they’ve never known before. They are empowered by the Spirit to communicate across languages, but really importantly, it’s not that the diversity of languages goes away. And most of the people present went home to their own nations afterwards. They were still scattered and they were still different. If Pentecost were a total reversal of Babel, you would expect that everybody now speaks Hebrew or Aramaic or Greek – whatever, as long as it’s all homogenous – and that they would immediately start working together to build one Empire again. If Babel is in part about diversity as a tool against oppressive empire, there is nothing in the Pentecost story that reverses that. In fact, it reinforces the importance of human diversity and rebukes ideas like \"colour-blindness\" that encourages us to ignore that diversity.\n\nI grew up in the 90’s in a small town that was almost entirely white, pretty much the peak of the colour-blindness idea. This is the idea that it is a good thing to avoid talking about racial differences. At its worst, this encourages us to turn a blind eye to racial injustice. For example, when somebody points out that police violence disproportionately targets Black people – and Latine people and indigenous people – one of the worst things we can do is pretend that race isn't real and therefore racism isn’t real. It is true that race is a social construct invented by white people for our benefit a few hundred years ago. That does not mean that it isn't real or that it doesn't have deadly consequences. We can’t even start to address those harms if we pretend we don’t see race.\n\nBut that's not the only problem with the colour-blindness idea. It also leaves us unable to appreciate all the incredible diversity of humanity, which we as Christians believe is the image of God.\n\nI didn’t want to add a third text to make the Scripture readers do today but one other option would have been [Galatians 3:28](https://bibles.org/bible/1fd99b0d5841e19b-02/GAL.3?passageId=GAL.3.28&q=galatians%203%3A28).\n\nThere it says that in Jesus there is no longer Jew nor Gentile, slave nor free, male nor female. Some of the early church believed that when we are resurrected with new bodies, we would be sex-less, literally neither male nor female.\n\nThat’s a really interesting idea, especially with what that would mean for non-binary and intersex people – maybe that means they’re already a step closer to the Kingdom of God - but I think I disagree. I don’t think God is interested in wiping out our differences. I read stories like Babel and Pentecost and think that God wants us to embrace the full spectrum of humanity: different languages, different genders, different abilities, different orientations, different races, everything. This text makes more sense to me when we look at it as demolishing societal hierarchies, not erasing the differences. The differences themselves are a good thing.\n\nI remember an episode of the Freakonomics podcast a few years ago talking about language and specifically about diversity of language. They had some experts on to talk about a couple purposes of language. One is obviously to communicate, to convey information from one person to another. But there’s also something to be said for the opposite: languages can divide us from each other by creating in-groups who can only communicate with each other without the out-group understanding it. This is the reason lots of children create their own languages or codes. It may exclude the out-group, but it really strengthens the bonds of the in-group to have something in common that not everybody else does, too. In the Babel story, we saw that a language barrier also makes it hard to force large amounts of people to do something against their will.\n\nOne of these experts concluded that in the ideal world everybody would speak two languages. There would be one language that the entire world spoke. We would have no barrier to be able to communicate with anybody when we wanted to. But then we would also have the language for our own in-group that would strengthen the bonds within that group. It would be both unity and diversity.\n\nThat’s what Pentecost does. Pentecost doesn’t reverse Babel. It doesn't make everybody speak the same language again. That would have been the easy way if the goal were to allow everybody to communicate with each other. God offers a much better gift to humanity: the ability to speak across that barrier _without erasing the differences_.\n\nThat makes me think of [another comic](https://nakedpastor.com/products/eraser), from the \"naked pastor,\" David Hayward. All the people are drawing lines between each other and Jesus is walking around them with an eraser wiping it all out while they give him dirty looks. But he isn’t wiping out their distinctiveness, only the lines between them.\n\nThe Pentecost vision shows us something much better than colour-blind ignoring our differences. It’s better than simply accepting differences. Instead, we celebrate differences like the Spirit embraced those languages brought together at Pentecost. When we have an opportunity to hear from somebody new, especially marginalized groups, we are eager to catch what new glimpses of the image of God we see in them.\n\nA few weeks ago, we learned more about the new Voices Together hymn book, including that it has more songs in languages other than English. I think this offers the potential for a small taste of the vision cast by God on Pentecost. We also had a song that week that summed up that Pentecost vision:\n\n> Summoned by the God who made us rich in our diversity\n> Gathered in the name of Jesus, richer still in unity\n> Let us bring the gifts that differ and, in splendid varied ways\n> Sing a new church into being, one in faith and love and praise\n\nWe won’t be perfect at living out this vision, of course. There are a lot of complicated systemic factors at play. We are all human. We will always have to fight against our worst impulses including the impulse to settle in comfortably with the people just like us instead of reaching across those social barriers. Even after Pentecost, the rest of Acts still has more stories of the early church relearning what it is like to break down barriers. We will need to show grace to each other. But the target that we bring each other back to is this Pentecost vision. May it be so. Amen.\n","date":"2021-05-23T10:30:00.000Z"},"/2022/way-leaf/":{"id":"/2022/way-leaf/","title":"Way of the Leaf","description":"A sermon about peace: holy war, just war, resisting nonviolently, and the justified anger of the oppressed.","tags":"posts Sermon","content":"\n## Texts\n\n[Confession of Faith - Mennonite Church Canada (article 22)](https://www.mennonitechurch.ca/cof)\n\n[Romans 12:9-21](https://bibles.org/bible/1fd99b0d5841e19b-02/ROM.12?passageId=ROM.12.9-ROM.12.18&q=romans%2012%3A9-21)\n\n## Transcript\n\n### Intro: The Centrality of Peace\n\nOne of the things I have most enjoyed about this long off-and-on series we've taken through the confession of faith is that it provides us some prompts to talk about things that we don't often talk about. Sometimes we don't talk about them because they're controversial things we shy away from. Sometimes they're things that we don't feel we need to name explicitly because they are largely assumed. Sometimes it's because they don't seem as relevant today as they did 500 years ago.\n\nAnd then there's peace. This one we do talk about explicitly at minimum once a year with Peace Sunday, but often more than that. If you ask somebody who is aware of Anabaptist theology just what makes an Anabaptist, they'll probably start with peace. Quick aside: for those who aren't aware, Anabaptist is the term for the wider theological tradition that Mennonites are a part of, started out of the 16th century Reformation era. If you're doing the concentric circles, Mennonites are within Anabaptists and Anabaptists are within Christians.\n\nNo offence to the avoidance of oaths – Arnold did a great job explaining the history behind that one and what we can still learn from it today – but most people do not think of that one nearly as quickly as they think of peace.\n\nWith that said, it can be true that we sometimes take for granted that we all know what we mean when say the word \"peace.\"\n\n### Revelation in Jesus\n\nEarly in this series on the confession of faith, I also spoke on the article about Jesus. I will sometimes argue that the most important theological question is what is God like. I don't mean attributes like power or relationship to time. I mean God's character. Is God fundamentally loving? Is God fundamentally peaceful?\n\nThe Christian answer – and emphasized by Anabaptists more than most – is that God looks like Jesus. Jesus is the most complete revelation of God's character. This article of the confession hits on that a bit as well. If we want to understand what peace looks like, the best place to look is at Jesus. He taught peace and his whole life, death, and resurrection embodied peace.\nThis is significant. We can mean a lot of different things by peace. The biggest alternative definition of peace which was prevalent in Jesus' time was the Pax Romana, the roman peace. It was peace through conquest. It was – and still is – a common philosophy that the best way to have peace is to have absolute control. Of course, that control is maintained through at least some occasional violence. At best, it's the \"you have to break a few eggs to make an omelette\" philosophy. At worst, it's fascism. This Pax Romana brought a lot of positive things to the Empire, like new roads and a massive reduction in regional conflicts.\n\nBut the price for that \"peace\" included subjugating minorities and mass crucifixions of anybody who dared to question the Roman authority. This peace, this wealth, this prosperity, is fuelled by death.\n\nI'm a fan of a lot of superhero movies and TV. This idea was captured the strongest for me recently in the DC character Peacemaker. That sounds promising, right? His name is Peacemaker. In the movie where he was introduced, he summarized his philosophy this way: \"I cherish peace with all my heart. I don't care how many men, women, and children I need to kill to get it.\" And now he's got a TV show that I haven't seen much, but it does look like it is doing some interesting exploration of how what he calls peace really means authoritarian control.\n\nIn the Christian tradition the philosophy like that of Peacemaker could be called holy war. Most wouldn't explicitly say that they believe in a holy war philosophy. That's a phrase that carries negative sentiment. But you do hear this rhetoric. In the most extreme forms, it comes out from a vocal minority that you might hear labelled with phrases like Christian nationalist or dominionist. But there are much less extreme versions as well. We all at least occasionally fall into the thought pattern of redemptive violence, that we can make the world better if we just had the right people exercising control over everyone else.\nSometimes peacemaking starts with acknowledging the ways we have fallen into that trap, either individually or as a community. I think of how when I joined staff at Laurier, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the new employee training included a significant course on Canadian Indigenous history. In line with one of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to action, Laurier wanted every staff member to have some basic understanding of how the relationship between Canada and Indigenous people has been broken and how we can help heal it. And a lot of how it was broken was because Christians believed that we were inherently superior and that \"peace\" for Canada meant doing a lot of horrible and violent things. We need to own that if we want to make the relationship right.\n\nEven within those comic book stories, the good guys end up solving their problems to some degree with violence as well. The third act of most superhero movies often involves the good guy punching the bad guy really hard until so-called peace is restored, at least until the start of the next movie. The heroes here might map more closely to what is called the just war tradition. In that school of thought – where most Christians and most people in general fall – violence is bad but it is sometimes necessary as a last resort.\n\n### Pax Christi\n\nJesus' definition of peace is different. Jesus teaches a peace through justice, a peace through restoration, a peace which is not only an ends to be achieved but also a means to achieve it. The confession does mention this a bit more in one of the footnotes. Citing the use of the Hebrew word Shalom, it explains that peace is more than the absence of physical violence; it is the restoration of right relationships. It is making the world whole again, just again.\n\nIf the most fundamental theological question is what God is like, I think the second most important to me at least might be the question of eschatology. What's the point of all this? What are we moving toward? What kind of world is possible? That's my little teaser for Scott to talk about the article for the reign of God in a couple weeks, but understanding what Jesus meant by peace I think is a big part of that answer.\n\nThese are fundamentally different perspectives on the world, not just a minor ethical question or a new rule that Christians are supposed to follow. To quote Melissa Florer-Bixler's book _How To Have an Enemy_, they are \"different and incompatible operating system[s].\"\n\n### Nonresistance\n\nThe other reading today gives us a bit more of what Jesus' alternate operating system looks like. I could have used Jesus' words in the Sermon on the Mount. In Matthew 5, Jesus gives some examples of what it looks like to resist evil in a nonviolent way. Those are pretty powerful examples when you understand the context, but they might not be intuitive in our context. Like, that being slapped on the right cheek means you were given a backhand, which is how somebody treats somebody who is lower than them, so by turning the other cheek and forcing them to slap the left instead, you are accepting a hit but also forcing them to treat you like a human equal. At the centre of that teaching is reframing the relationship, with the oppressor and the oppressed seeing each other as an equal.\n\nI think of the peacemakers of the Black Lives Matter movement, much like other anti-racism movements before them. It can be uncomfortable, both for the oppressor and the oppressed, but at the heart of this movement is that simple phrase: Black Lives Matter. It is an assertion of humanity and equality and a call to eliminate the ways our society acts as if that isn't true.\nThat's as far as I'll go with the Matthew text. There's a stereotype that Anabaptists love quoting Jesus and ignore the epistles, while evangelicals love quoting Paul and ignore Jesus. So I picked Romans 12 instead because I wanted to show that Paul was on the same page.\n\nRomans 12 is loaded with actions. Love each other. Honour each other. Stand your ground. Hope. Contribute to the needs of others. Welcome strangers. Consider everyone equal and associate with people on the margins of society. Feed your enemy if he's hungry. Give water to your enemy if he's thirsty.\n\nSometimes that is the big activist movement like Black Lives Matter. Sometimes it is much quieter, like volunteering with the Saturday Suppers to make sure those who need a meal can get one. I've never done Saturday Suppers but several years ago I did volunteer a few times with a similar program, Royal City Mission in Guelph. I remember showing up thinking I could do some quiet behind the scenes work washing dishes. Instead I was told they always have no problem with the dishes but what really matters the most is simply having people in the room with the guests. People came to these dinners because they needed food, but they also needed somebody to listen to them, to care about their stories. I saw similar with Queen St Commons Café here in Kitchener, although there I did successfully hide washing dishes most of the time.\n\nThis is not what a lot of people think of as \"pacifism.\" A lot of people hear the word pacifist and believe that means passive. If you say you're a pacifist to enough people, you'll eventually hear responses like \"so you think we should have just let Hitler conquer the whole world?\" It's a misunderstanding of the peace tradition but it's also a profound lack of creativity that believes the only two options are doing nothing or using physical violence. The word pacifism is from pacify, not passive. It's an active verb to make something clean.\n\nThat does bring me to my biggest concern for possible misinterpretation with the wording of this article. At the time this was written, the language of \"nonresistance\" was more common.\n\nThe article does later name resisting evil, both in the main text and in the footnotes. So I don't think the authors of the confession meant this, but hearing the term \"nonresistance\" now usually gets read as not doing anything to resist. If you're going to use the word nonresistance, you have to be clear that you do not mean quiet passivity in the face of evil.\nThat's why I, and a lot of people much smarter than me, have tended in recent years toward the language of nonviolent resistance instead of nonresistance. We do resist evil. But we do it nonviolently.\n\nAs Florer-Bixler says:\n\n> enemies are overcome not through tolerance but by making the world new.\n\n### Privilege and Anger\n\nOne of the negative consequences that comes from treating peace as doing nothing is that language of peace and pacifism is often used against the marginalized. Whenever you see the slightest resistance to oppression, even when it's not violent in any way, you'll inevitably hear comments about how their cause is good, but they should really protest in a less disruptive way. And yet the same criteria is not turned to ask the oppressors to stop their actual violence that prompted the protest in the first place. That is not peace. It is ironically violence – telling them to shut up and stay in their place of oppression – being done in the name of nonviolence.\n\nI think of someone I worked with who is relentless about accessibility for people with disabilities. Accessibility is often treated as an afterthought in our culture, a nice-to-have if you there's time left over. And sometimes he was noticeably upset when he learned about how it took a blind user half an hour to find the right page on the website, which is more like 5 minutes for the average sighted user. He cared about that justice and right relationship with that marginalized community. But it is an act of peacemaking when he heard the stories, agreed that there is a problem, and got everyone else involved in figuring out how to fix it. It would not be peacemaking if he tried to sweep it under the rug to make us look better or save us time.\nFlorer-Bixler also talks about the psalms of lament and even what are sometimes called the imprecatory psalms, where the psalmist experiencing real oppression pleads with God for harm to be done to their oppressor. Some of these texts are hard, like calls to bash the heads of children across the rocks. These are psalms that many churches try to ignore, but they remind us of the extent of human suffering. Sometimes all that a hurting person can imagine is getting vengeance.\n\nWith that in mind, it's actually an incredibly powerful decision to be in those depths of pain and choose to release that to God. They do not take violence into their own hands. When they have suffered true evil – more than I have ever or likely will ever experience - they don't take revenge. As much as it sounds like they want terrible things to happen, there's no indication that they ever took any steps to make those terrible things happen. Instead, we get stories elsewhere like David refusing to kill Saul even as Saul is trying to kill him, and advice like that of Paul here in Romans to overcome evil with good while leaving judgement to God. Paul says that's how you heap burning coals on your enemy's head.\n\n### Real Victory\n\nBecause I am a nerd, I will reference another recent nerdy TV property. In the first season of _The Wheel of Time_, a couple of the main characters – Perrin and Egwene - encounter a group called the Tuatha'an. They're a nomadic people committed to what they call The Way of the Leaf and to finding the song that will heal the world. Not a weapon that will save the world by enabling them to defeat the villain, but a song that will heal the world.\n\nOne of the Tuatha'an is explaining their ways and talking about when her family was murdered. Perrin asks her why she didn't want revenge. She clarifies that revenge was all she wanted. In that moment of incredible pain, it was the only thing she could imagine, much like those psalmists. But then she says:\n\n> What greater revenge against violence than peace? What greater revenge against death than life?\n\nThat sounds a lot to me like Paul's heaping burning coals comment. The way to get revenge is to love your enemy, because the real enemy is not the person but the harm they're doing.\n\nThe Way of the Leaf says that even if a leaf dies, it feeds new life, planting the seeds for a new tree. Similarly, if they die but more people are called to their way of peace, it's worth it. Responding to violence with more violence does not bring about healing of the world. There's no revenge on the violence there. It feeds the same cycle. But responding to violence with peace, responding to death with life? That plants the seeds of a better world.\n\n### Conclusion: Peacemakers\n\nOne thing I wonder is what if this Way of the Leaf is already the song that will heal the world. Maybe it's not a flashy magical thing that will dismantle evil overnight. Maybe it's long hard work that takes a lot of sacrifice.\n\nAnd that makes me think of those I have encountered who are singing this song, the people who are choosing the little ways of getting revenge on violence through peace. I've named a few today.\n\nWhat I would like to do is invite you to name some of your own in our Zoom time today. Where have you seen peacemakers? Who are the people that you've watched do something and it's made you say, \"whoa, the world is really closer to justice because of this?\" That could be somebody you worked with directly, a big social movement that inspired you, or it could even be something that you did. Feel free to brag a little.\n\nI will see you all on there soon. Blessed be the peacemakers.\n","date":"2022-01-30T10:30:00.000Z"},"/2023/appetizer-way/":{"id":"/2023/appetizer-way/","title":"Appetizer of the Way","description":"Communion is an appetizer of the Kingdom of God, embodied and inclusive.

Years ago, we were getting up to leave from a service with communion. Emily commented to me how she was hungry. And this is a glimpse into the weird way my brain works sometimes. The part of my brain that studied neuroscience kicked in and I wondered out loud if there was a bit of the appetizer effect.\n\nThe basic idea of the appetizer effect is that the experience of a little bit of food, especially certain types of food, triggers your brain that it is time to eat, so your body redirects its energy from other functions to prioritize getting ready to digest the food. Then when more food doesn't come quickly enough, you're hungrier than if you hadn't eaten that appetizer, because now your body is trying to digest something that hasn't arrived. And then my neuroscience brain quickly took a back seat and my theology brain jumped in. I started thinking that this is what is happening with communion, maybe in a physical sense but definitely in a spiritual sense.\n\nA phrase you'll sometimes hear in theological speak is the idea that the Kingdom of God is now, but not yet. There is some sense in which it is started, but it's not yet complete. So, my own phrasing of that idea today is we can experience an appetizer of the way of Jesus now, especially at the communion table, but it's not the whole meal yet.\nI hope this analogy works for somebody else because it has been stuck in my head for several years.\n\n### Ed's Sermon\n\nAt one point I was scheduled to preach this on World Communion Day 2020, before, you know, all the plans changed for a couple of years. One of the best things to come out of that delay is that Ed gave a great sermon about communion back in May.\n\nEd's had a bit more of a deconstructionist lens. If you are starting from a place with a damaging view of communion, where it feels harmful to you, it is often important to dismantle that first before you can start trying to construct something healthier. So, if you need to deconstruct some more first, I won't blame you if you tune me out and go listen to Ed's instead (unfortunately it is not available publicly).\n\nEd's starting point was that communion should not be about qualification, whether by baptism or anything else. It's an invitation. It comes with some meaning and responsibility to accept that invitation, some expectation that we will be changed, but everybody is invited. He also gets into some other aspects like the symbolisms of bread and wine, which I'm going to avoid repeating, but are also great.\n\nI've heard others use the language that communion is filling, or satisfying, which might seem contradictory to my appetizer analogy. And there's one level that I think that's true, that it should feel substantial on its own, that a meal within a loving community is already powerful. And like the deconstruction idea, it might depend on your context, too. Maybe today you really need to experience this and let that be enough.\n\nI think this idea that Ed gave, of an invitation into something good, rather than a qualification list, fits very well with my appetizer analogy. If we're doing communion well, we should feel like we are being invited into something good, but it's not just the good of the communion table for its own sake. That's just a taste of the bigger Way of Jesus that everyone is invited into.\n\n### Jesus' Embodied Table\n\nIn the book _Searching for Sunday_ that a group of us are reading together, author Rachel Held Evans points out that there are lot of varieties in how we do communion across traditions. But one thing that is pretty consistent is the use of the word “remember.” We have it engraved on the front of our table. At the simplest level, the invitation of this ritual is to remember. One of the other names for this ritual is Eucharist, which means the Thanksgiving. It's a remembering, something that we are thankful for.\n\nI took a course on human memory in university. I don't remember most of it.\n\nBut I do remember some of how to reinforce memories. Repetition is a huge part of it. The more you do something, the stronger that pathway will be. That's a lot of why we do rituals in general, or set up statues and plaques, or do things like land acknowledgements and wearing orange Every Child Matters shirts. The more we encounter something and associate it with some deeper meaning, the more that meaning becomes reinforced in our brain.\n\nAnother big factor in strengthening memory is embodiment. The more cues we are giving our brain, from multiple senses, the more possibilities for our memory pathways to activate.\n\nIn _Searching for Sunday_, Rachel quotes from Barbara Brown Taylor:\n\n> With all the conceptual truths in the universe at his disposal, Jesus did not give them something to think about together when he was gone. Instead, he gave them concrete things to do – specific ways of being together in their bodies – that would go on teaching them what they needed to know when he was no longer around to teach them himself… ‘Do this,' he said – not believe this but do this – ‘in remembrance of me.'\n\nIt's also worth noting that this is a communal memory. It is not primarily about you individually. It is about us as a community choosing to remember Jesus and shape our communal life around that memory.\n\nWe won't remember perfectly because we are not perfect people. But we can get that appetizer taste, that spark of hunger that reminds us that this is a story that we want to be a part of.\n\n### Equitable Expanding Table\n\nIf it is in remembrance of Jesus, that means it is Jesus's table, not ours, which may reinforce the idea that it can be a little silly and missing the point for us to draw up qualifications about who gets to eat at Jesus' table.\n\nOne of Jesus' parables in the Gospels, the passage from Luke that we read today, is about a man who decided to throw a banquet, then struggled to find people who would accept the invitation. We sang the song in my church growing up that openly mocked those who are too important to accept the invitation. It's weird as a hymn to be openly mocking people, and even weirder that we sang in the voice of those we were mocking. The chorus would say, “I cannot come to the banquet, don't trouble me now, I have married a wife, I have bought me a cow.”\n\nThere is some responsibility to joining a party, as the important people who rejected the invitation demonstrate. It costs time, including time away from your new cow, I guess. It might be awkward if you don't know everyone. If you're a narcoleptic introvert like me, it might just be really tiring and you'll need a month to recover. Just like I probably will after speaking a lot today.\n\nThe host of the banquet in the parable isn't chasing the respectable important people who have said no, isn't pleading with them or coercing them into something they don't want to do. We see similar in other times in Jesus' ministry, where somebody walks away because they've decided the cost is too great, and Jesus lets him. If one extreme is the fence declaring who is allowed in and who is not, the other extreme would be trying to force everybody to take part whether they want to or not, which is largely the story of Christendom up to and including some Christian nationalist movements today.\n\nI also wonder if part of why many of these important people declined was because they knew this was the kind of host who would invite others that they didn't want to be associated with. The host doesn't stop trying to expand the table, next calling for the poor and disabled to be brought in.\n\nIn the context of communion and church in general, there might be a few reasons why we would want to opt out, but if we're doing this church thing right, I think the biggest one is that it will feel like a cost if you are used to being privileged. And we might decide that we don't want to pay that cost.\n\nRight before the parable in this reading, Jesus says to start with inviting the poor and otherwise marginalized. To use a phrase from liberation theology, God has a preferential option for the poor. That's where God starts. The rituals, the systems, the structures, need to be centred around the most marginalized.\n\nStarting with the marginalized ensures that everybody who wants to be a part of it gets to eat. This comes toward the so-called paradox of tolerance, the idea that you must be intolerant of the intolerant or else it isn't safe for those being hurt by the intolerant. It's my least favourite so-called paradox, because I don't think of it quite that way. That relies on still using the fence or qualification language. I want to stick with the invitation language. It isn't simply an invitation to eat and drink, period. It is an invitation into the Way of Jesus. The table of Jesus is a place of safety and openness for all. If you are entering that table in a way that violates that, you're not really joining Jesus' table – you're trying to replace it with a different table more to your liking.\n\nI initially had a longer section here about a text in Corinthians that you might be familiar with, but I had to cut that for time. If you're interested, ask about it in the Adult Ed. But the bottom line is that sometimes to maintain a table that remembers the invitation of Jesus for everybody, we have to point out where we are setting up boundaries. Maybe without even realizing it because they're so built into our culture's way of doing things. Maybe for a reason that made sense in the past but has become counter-productive now.\n\nWe won't do this equitable table perfectly, especially when we are starting from a largely privileged position. Again, this is an appetizer. We aim to do it enough that we get hungry for more. That sparks a positive feedback loop, where another person feels safe here, and they might help us see another way that we could do better.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSo, as we receive the elements today, I hope that it gives us a little taste of a better world. I hope that it gives us more hope, and then when we go back to seeing a broken world and we feel that disconnect, instead of being discouraged, we use that hunger to empower us to help better feed ourselves and others. I hope that it will be our appetizer for the Way.\n\n## Adult Ed / Deleted Scenes\n\nThese are parts that got cut from the sermon and/or I had in mind for the Adult Ed discussion.\n\n### Potlucks/Feasts and Communion\n\nThere is a similar but different tradition. It probably even started as the same ritual and evolved in two different directions. Today we might call it a potluck or a feast. While the communion ritual is usually more somber and reflective, with a small amount of very specific elements, the potluck is a lot more casual and a lot more filling. I talked about the embodied aspect earlier and this goes in that direction even farther. It's chaotic. We don't know exactly what food we'll get. We don't know how many people will come and all the dietary restrictions they might have. It's a lot messier, because bodies are messy and communities are messy.\n\nBoth traditions are important, and I think are at their best together.\n\n### Embodied Memory\n\nAlong the same lines of the embodied tradition and how that helps memory, I briefly had a bit more in the sermon about the story of the disciples on the Road to Emmaus. In the Gospel of Luke, a couple of disciples were walking on the road to Emmaus when a stranger joins them. The stranger talks about how everything that has happened is a fulfillment of Scripture. They don't recognize him until they share a meal together, when they realize it is the resurrected Jesus. There's something about a meal that makes it easier to see Jesus, compared to any number of hours spent analyzing Bible stories or reading systematic theologies or wrestling with apologetics – all things that can be good in their place.\n\nThere are many ways that Christianity, especially in the modern Western world, has become disembodied. We often boil down Christianity to something more abstract about what we believe. In a lot of churches including this one, we mostly show up, sit still, listen, and think. The one embodied thing we do consistently is sing. Other traditions may do a bit more in terms of movement like Pentecostals or in terms of engaging other senses like Orthodox churches using smell. But when we receive communion, we need to slow down a little, stop overthinking everything, and take a bit of wine or juice and a bit of bread, and take care of our bodies together.\n\nThere are at least a couple dimensions that can add some tensions to this as we consider our own worship service. We may say we want to be more embodied, but there are other considerations, too.\n\nOne is considering those who are joining us online. That's always going to be a mediated experience to some degree. We'll do everything we can to reduce friction, but it won't be quite the same. So there's some tension there. For example, maybe we wanted to more regularly do the passing of the peace where we stand up, walk around, maybe shake hands or hug, and wish the peace of Christ for each other. I really like that tradition. I had a seminary professor who had this incredible pastoral sense with that one, the way that he shook our hand where he would then put his left hand on top, holding us in place for a second, while looking us straight in the eye and saying the peace of Christ. We could do that, and it might be really meaningful for a lot of people on location, but it also might be tougher for those online since it would draw more attention to the thing they aren't a part of, at least not in the same way.\n\nSimilarly is factoring in disabilities. Some ways of making worship more embodied might help some disabled groups. We are so much based on what we hear that other practices might make it a lot easier for deaf people. But that could create problems for others, like if we want people to move more than what are we doing for those who can't move easily?\n\n### Active Liberation\n\nAnother idea I tried to get across was actively tearing down barriers, not just accepting people who do manage to get over the barriers.\n\nI had a bit in there at one point about the hymn, \"Draw the Circle Wide.\" We might even have it in our hymn book. A church I went to in Kingston loved that song, so much that it was getting kind of annoying. It's not my favourite style of music, but what I really appreciate about it thinking back on it is how active and persistent it is in its words. Draw the circle wide, draw it wider still. It is not simply calling us to allow more people into the circle, if they're first able to get through whatever barriers are in the way. It is an intentional drawing the circle wider, making sure that more and more are welcome. It is tearing down those barriers.\n\nA lot of people aren't going to bother telling you about a barrier they encountered, at least not until you've already established some trust with them. Most will simply never come. So we do have to be somewhat proactive about looking for that feedback and for trying to predict it using as much empathy as we can. For example, if I'm up there talking about the importance of inviting everybody to the table, and then we don't have a plan for how you can get to the table in a wheelchair or with a cane, or how we're going to coordinate timing with those online so that we can all eat together, it might just feel hypocritical.\n\nWhat barriers do we have up that might be stopping people from getting to our church, or to the table? I know this is a hard question for a lot of people because we always want to assume that we are already perfectly inclusive, but I do think we sometimes need to slow down and try to imagine what barriers might exist for others we aren't noticing ourselves.\n\n### Confession and 1 Corinthians 11\n\nI initially had a second reading, from [1 Corinthians 11:17-33](https://bibles.org/bible/1fd99b0d5841e19b-02/1CO.11?passageId=1CO.11.17-1CO.11.26&q=1%20Corinthians%2011%3A17-33).\n\nThere's that one verse in there that you may have heard out of context, that you should not receive the Lord's Supper in an unworthy manner. That verse sometimes gets used to set up the qualifications, to keep out those people who have done that wrong thing. If you start at verse 23 or 27, in a Western individualistic culture, it makes a lot of sense to read it that way.\n\nIt ties into the confession idea. One of the things I've heard most about a lot of Mennonite traditions is encouraging everyone to reflect on their relationship with God and if there's anything wrong, make it right before communion. Which I think is often tied to this text.\n\nBeing encouraged to reflect and repent individually is important. But I don't really like it being tied to communion. For one because it has that potential to be interpreted as another fence, that I'm not allowed to receive the elements if I'm not perfect. For another, it kind of muddies a big dose of individualism into a communal ritual.\n\nBut if you zoom out a little to include starting at verse 20 and ending at verse 33, you can see some very specific context. The specific problem, the way in which it was being done in an unworthy manner, was that the rich were showing up, eating all the food, and getting drunk on all the wine before everyone else who had to work all day could get there. It is always funny to me to imagine getting drunk off the tiny cups that we use. Obviously, they did things a bit differently then. But what wasn't funny is that it was amplifying existing inequities in their society, making the ritual something purely for the rich and reinforcing that everybody else is less than.\n\nThere's even a bit in that text about how people are sick and dying because communion isn't being done right. Without the context, it sounds like God is killing people for daring to take it as unworthy individuals. But once I started at verse 20 or earlier, I couldn't help but wonder if it means that the ones who are getting sick and dying are the poor, because they aren't getting any food. Some of the judgement language makes it sound like the rich are being judged and we'd assume they were then the ones getting sick, but that is an individualistic reading. It is consistent with a more Hebrew mindset that the whole community is judged together, so it might still make sense that he was saying the judgement was the community suffering because the community was doing things in a way that amplified social inequities instead of solving them.\n\nI did notice the confession prayer today was very communal, a lot of “we” language rather than I language, so even though I don't really like tying it to communion, I did like that.\n\n### World Communion – A Unifying Tradition\n\nI cut my final big section that dealt with the “world” part of “World Communion Sunday.”\n\nTwo of the most powerful communion experiences in my life were both when expanding outside my denominational tradition. When I was 16, I was a part of a team that went to Venezuela. Near the end of the week, we had communion together: our Venezuelan hosts, about a dozen Canadian Anglicans, and about a dozen Canadian Uniteds. And we did it in a way I've never encountered elsewhere: we stood up in pairs, hugged, and then served the elements to our partner. After a week of working closely and experiencing the world together, it was deeply intimate in its small scale.\n\nA few years later, I experienced the opposite end of the size scale. I was at a university student conference in St. Louis. On the last night, New Years Eve, about 20,000 of us took communion together. We came from all over the world and all Christian traditions. But in that time together, we were reminded that we were all part of this same movement, all remembering Jesus together. This one wasn't intimate. It was overwhelming in the scale of realizing how big of a thing we were all a part of, how expansive God's love can be.\n\nI've done this ritual with the United Church, with Anglicans, with Baptists, with Pentecostals, with Anabaptists, at nondenominational conferences and in unaffiliated small groups. I've done it with the little cups getting passed through the seats, with people lining up to pick up the elements at the front as we usually do here, with intinction aka \"rip and dip\" where we dip the bread into the shared cup, and drinking from the common cup with the priest wiping it in between. And no matter how many variations there are and theologies trying to explain it, it always feels to me like I am part of something so much bigger than myself, than Rockway, than Mennonites.\n\n### Practical Questions\n\nSome of the little practical questions that came up as we discussed over the past few weeks:\n\nThe grapes: for a while, part of our communion tradition was offering grapes as an alternative. I liked this idea personally, but acknowledge I was in the minority. It gave a bit of a halfway option if you're not quite comfortable with receiving the traditional elements, but still want to be welcomed and included. I compare it to a time I went to a Catholic church and I went up and crossed my arm to receive the blessing instead of the elements. I didn't want to disrespect what the elements meant to them, knowing I am not Catholic, but I came away feeling good that there was still an option to be included. So to me, that's what the grapes are: a halfway option. Not a fence for who isn't allowed to take the elements, but an option acknowledging that some people are going to be in the middle.\n\nFrequency: how often do you think we should do communion? Potlucks? Acknowledging that there are more practical needs to make it work, I personally think both should be more like once a month.\n\nCommunal memory: how do we best convey that it is a communal memory? One that came up with Thomas was having him pour the cup and break some bread in front of us, rather than only pointing at the individual serving sizes that everybody would eat from. I think I've seen it done both ways here at Rockway, and I like seeing the breaking and pouring, as it underlines the more communal experience. Of course, even more communal is sharing the common cup and common loaf that we have to rip from, as in some traditions, but that also is somewhat less practical needing more time per person and perhaps with more risk of spreading contagious disease.\n\n### Liminality, Sacraments, and Ordinances\n\nI had a seminary classmate who was on more of a research track than pastoral and he loved talking about liminal spaces and liminal rituals. A more mystical phrase for it might be a \"thin place.\"\n\nAnabaptists traditionally call communion an ordinance. Our tradition doesn't have \"sacraments.\" A sacrament is that thin place or liminal concept, something special about it that makes it easier to connect with God. An ordinance just means that we do it because Jesus told us to, which I find a little underwhelming. I tend more toward the Reformed, maybe even leaning toward Lutheran, understanding, where there is something special about this, if not necessarily because God is doing something different than at least because there is value in the communal repetition. Which ties into what I was saying earlier about memory.\n\nI also had a Mastodon conversation recently about this that spun into the question of who is the active participant in this ritual. Are we primarily talking about what God does, or what we do? I've mostly talked about what we do, and that is consistent with Anabaptist tradition. Traditions that are more sacramental would tend toward the other direction, emphasizing that this is about God's grace to us much more than it is about anything we do.\n\n### Bad Joke\n\nI referenced that the paradox of tolerance was my least favourite paradox. My favourite paradox is the Rick Astley paradox. It is impossible to ask Rick Astley to give you his favourite Pixar movie, because he is never going to give you Up, but in the process, he has let you down. That joke might be too much aimed at Extremely Online Millennials to make sense for this congregation.\n","date":"2023-10-01T10:30:00.000Z"},"/2024/new-blog/":{"id":"/2024/new-blog/","title":"New Blog","description":"I'm putting together this site to be used as a place to hold some infrequent theology and adjacent writing.","tags":"posts","content":"\nMany years ago I was a regular blogger.

I also always end up improvising a little when I speak, so what is written down is not exactly the same as what would be captions on the video.\n\n### Introduction\n\n“There’s a lot of weirdness in this text.” That was the opening line of a podcast episode from Yale Divinity where they look at a passage from the lectionary briefly each week, including this week’s Mark text. Yeah, I think that’s a pretty good assessment. Most of it is very familiar if you’ve been around the church for long. But that doesn’t make it that much less weird. There is a lot that feels like non-sequiturs, jumping between loosely related ideas, and in my experience most sermons using it end up picking a specific part to zone in on rather than trying to treat it as one whole.\n\nWhen I first read it in preparation for today, the first section is what I zoned in on. I started with the punchline “whoever is not against us is with us.”\n\nThere was also [a Numbers text in the lectionary for today, chapter 11:4-29](https://bibles.org/bible/1fd99b0d5841e19b-02/NUM.11?passageId=NUM.11.4-NUM.11.13&q=numbers%2011%3A4-29), which has a parallel story. As the disciples do with Jesus in Mark, Moses’ assistant Joshua comes to Moses and tells Moses to stop a couple people from prophesying. Like Jesus in the Mark story, Moses doesn’t see it as a problem at all, instead glad that others are also doing good work, and warns Joshua not to be jealous for his sake.\n\nThere’s a good lesson there about celebrating those who are acting in line with our values, even if they aren’t active in our church or any church.\n\nThat was it. That was the whole original sermon idea.\n\nBut unfortunately for those of you think sermons are too long, I kept thinking about these texts. And I kept thinking about the general state of Christianity in North America. And I kept coming across books and podcasts that seemed to have relevant things to say. In fact, I kept thinking about them enough that, in combination with some needed juggling of the worship schedule, this changed from one sermon into two. I will also be speaking again next week, continuing where I leave off today but from a slightly different direction.\n\n### Power and Christian Institution\n\nFirst, I looked at more context of the Mark passage to try to connect some of those seemingly disconnected pieces. Sometimes it's easy when we mostly encounter the Bible in these little segments to forget that these stories were pieced together the way they were for a reason. The Bible didn’t originally have the section headers we have now; those are put in by modern translators and don’t even always agree with each other. It didn’t even have chapter and verse numbers for a long time, or for that matter, even punctuation in the original Greek. Mark was just one long book.\n\nI found that the section before the lectionary text is helpful for some framing. There, Jesus says that he will be killed and then rise again. The disciples don’t get it. So of course, they don’t ask any follow-up questions, which is a great way to continue to not get it. Then the disciples were debating with each other about who is the greatest. Jesus tells them that whoever wants to be first must be least of all, then calls in a nearby child to emphasize the point: whoever welcomes one of these children in his name welcomes him. That is some of our thematic context: the disciples are trying to position themselves to be near the top of the Jesus follower hierarchy. Jesus tries to teach them to reverse their thinking to prioritize the marginalized, particularly in this case, children.\n\nWith that in mind, I think a lot of that conflict is carrying forward into today’s text. We see that the disciples were not upset with what this other person was doing, the casting out demons part. They weren’t even upset with his attitude doing it. They say that he was doing it in Jesus’ name. That phrase is easy for us to read as if the name Jesus or Christ or Christian is a magic word. That is often how it gets used today. Sometimes if we’re being honest, when we end a prayer with “in Jesus’ name”, we’re probably thinking of it like a magic word, thinking that makes it more likely that we’ll get what we want. But also more to the point here, it is often used as a magic word by others like politicians and online social influencers. In that context, it is used to manufacture consent by meaning things like “we’re the good guys, you should vote for us, and you definitely shouldn’t be upset about all the terrible things we are doing because we are CHRISTIANS and that is all that matters!” I’m going to be talking about them more directly next week.\n\nBut in that cultural context, the phrasing “in the name of” means more like “a representative of.” If you do something in the name of the king, you’re saying that you’re doing what the king wanted you to do. A modern twist on that might be “don’t shoot the messenger.” If the messenger is relaying what somebody with higher authority told them to do, and you don’t like the message, the person you’re really upset with is the higher authority, not the messenger. So when the disciples are saying that this exorcist is doing it in Jesus’ name, they probably mean that he was doing it in a way consistent with Jesus.\n\nThe disciples acknowledged that this exorcist was doing a good thing for the right reasons, but were upset “because he wasn’t following us.” He’s outside of their perceived in-group, outside their desired power structure. And like the previous passage, Jesus again conveys that they’ve missed the point and need to flip their concept of power.\n\nWe’re talking about two groups. There are people in the Jesus institution – for lack of a better word - doing good work, and people who are inspired by Jesus but not part of the institution also doing good work. Obviously, there are a lot of other groups in the world, some of which I’ll talk about more in part two next week.\n\nIn the modern world, that latter group is often those who decided they couldn’t put up with all the problems of the church but are still compelled by Jesus in some way. This is a substantial group, mainly because the church has messed up a lot. There’s a lot of reasons why people might have problems with Christianity. Even within the themes of hierarchy and power, there is a lot to work with, past and present. Crusades and witch hunts and inquisitions and colonialism and residential school and many aspects of the current wave of Christian nationalism, and on and on.\n\nThis quest for power, in both the disciples and the modern church, is usually backed up by what Brian McLaren calls a cult of innocence, in his book _Do I Stay Christian_. To justify that your group should rule over others, you need to believe that your group is the correct pure group, and those others are evil that must be punished, or at least inferior that must be controlled.\nAnd it is really easy for me to hear that and think “yeah, I’m so glad I don’t have that attitude like some other people. I’m so glad that I am one of the good guys. I’m never judgemental like those bad guys! We have to find a way to stop them!” And then I realize that I just did my own cult of innocence thinking. It’s a human temptation, not unique to some other group of people we don’t like. It’s one that we aren’t immune to, and the more we think we’re immune to it the more likely we are to fall into it.\n\n### Cutting It Off\n\nThat brings us back to the second part of the Mark text. In my experience, a lot of the time I have heard this passage quoted started at verse 43: if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off, and so on. I think I heard that a lot as a teenager and young adult being on the fringes of the purity culture movement. I wasn’t getting nearly the worst of it as my church was pretty good, but I got some tangentially especially as the Internet became a thing. It was used to sell things like monitoring software on your computer to make sure you weren’t accessing pornography. The text was interpreted that you should cut off the ways that you individually sin – and of course the only real sins worth talking about are the sexual ones. And I don’t want to completely squash the general idea there. There is some wisdom in identifying your weak points and having the self-control to avoid them. But also, the extreme focus on sex was bad, and even the better more general version is maybe missing some context here.\n\nThe context for Mark here is somebody who has harmed a child, or in an interesting bit of phrasing, has caused a child to sin. In that case, the thing that we’re talking about needing to be cut off might be more about harmful power structures and the attitudes that support them within our community, not about individual computer access. They need to be cut off before they become engrained in children, causing them to then continue the cycles of violence.\n\nFor me, this is where the cult of innocence attitude jumps in again. See, this text tells me to cut off those terrible Christian nationalists! They are obviously harming the marginalized and amplifying these cycles of violence. I should spend all my free time on the Internet making sure to tell strangers about how those aren’t real Christians, not like I am!\n\nAnd then I check myself again. For one, arguing with strangers on the Internet is mostly counterproductive. But I think more importantly, it leads into that much bigger problem of strengthening the cult of innocence.\n\nToday we are observing Truth and Reconciliation Day, including in the second hour. I’ve heard this cult of innocence come up in conversations around that, too. It usually goes something like “those who committed the atrocities of the residential schools thought they were doing a good thing.” And it’s probably true that a lot of them did, because they subscribed to this cult of innocence where obviously they were superior and had to enforce their ways on others who are inferior. But when we say that as an excuse, a way to look away from the atrocities, we are refusing to acknowledge the harms done. We are setting up ourselves to do similar harms out of our own cult of innocence. We haven’t addressed the root of the problem being our sense of superiority.\n\nThat’s the kind of scenario where this language about needing to cut off a part of the church body might come into play. It is cutting off the part of the church that might allow abuse. It is cutting off the pursuit of power over and against others. It is cutting off the superiority of my group over their group.\n\nThe Mark text feels like a strict binary. That’s not unusual for rabbis in that time to talk in hyperbole.\n\nIn practice, all of this can get messier. It isn’t always clear what constitutes abuses of power and what is a difference of opinion about some complicated moral question.\n\nAnd there is some bad history, for Mennonites and elsewhere, of rushing to apply “the ban” or “church discipline” to way too many things, banning anybody who doesn’t fit the high standards of the community. This then creates the power structure in the other direction, with the church now the abuser of the person they’ve kicked out.\n\nTo speak in very broad generalities, a lot of conservative churches today would err on that side, quick to cast out somebody who doesn’t follow all the rules sufficiently. A lot of liberal churches have the opposite problem, where they are afraid of standing up for anything in case they go too far and alienate somebody already in the community. In doing so they end up supporting an abusive status quo. I think that’s the idea at the end of the reading, about the salt losing its saltiness. If there isn’t some unique substance to a community that makes it safe for the oppressed, they might end up through passivity with the same result as the overly aggressive power-seeking community.\n\n### James’ Vision of Community\n\nThere was another text read today. Ultimately, I included this James reading instead of the Numbers text because I think it provides some needed balance. The emphasis in this one is on restoration, bringing somebody back into community, rather than cutting somebody or something off. Two things about this community are named:\n\n1. They confess their sins together.\n2. They pray together and sing together.\n\nI think those two components are a valuable part of this bigger discussion of how we retain our saltiness against this domination mentality, without falling into that mentality ourselves.\n\nConfessing our sins together helps combat the cult of innocence. That quest for power, that desire to rule over others, needs that fuel of feeling superior. And when we instead have a culture of being able to admit when we’ve messed up, or the things we’re struggling with, and we’re working together to do better, it’s a lot harder for that cult of innocence to take hold. It’s hard to want to dominate others while having a true sense of your own weaknesses. Not in a shameful way, just an honest one.\nSeveral years ago, we were doing a series on the Mennonite Confession of Faith. Apparently, I’m a glutton for punishment taking hard topics that nobody else wants to talk about. This week and next week are things like discipline and nationalism and Christian identity. That time I looked at the Confession of Faith and promptly signed up for the article on sin. After talking about confession and repentance in some more detail than I did today, Scott got up for the congregational prayer and jokingly asked if anybody wanted to make a big public confession. To be clear, that’s not what I’m talking about, except maybe if it is a case where you harmed the whole community then you might need to apologize to the whole community. But for the most part, I’m talking more about the kinds of things that were highlighted in the service a couple weeks ago around a horizontal caring community. Ideally there would be someone or a small group that you feel safe talking to about the things you’re struggling with, or the way you harmed somebody and are trying to make it better. And a big part of the work of a local church is fostering an environment where those kinds of relationships can form and include everybody.\n\nThe other idea from the James text is praying together and singing together. These are both ways to build a sense of community and shared values, to align our priorities with each other, with wider Christian tradition, and with God. They help us define ourselves as ourselves in a positive way. We’re not primarily defined by being better than them. Instead: What are we for? What is the kind of community that we want to be? When you have a clear vision of what you are, not only who or what you are against, your attention is focused there in the centre instead of on the boundaries trying to police who is and who isn’t good enough.\n\nA few years ago, we had an exercise explicitly like this. We developed as a church a vision statement that in part says, “we continue to grow and learn as we seek to live Christ’s wisdom and peace in the world.” Over time I’ve grown to like that statement more and more. We have a clearly defined positive centre, Christ’s wisdom and peace, and we acknowledge that we won’t always get it right but will keep growing together.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe’ve been in an interesting time as a congregation for a few years, basically since soon after that statement. Covid stopped us from meeting in person for a year and a half. Some who used to be regulars never came back. Some are joining us online, for any of a few very good reasons, not just Covid. Then our pastor of many years left, and we had some time with an interim pastor arrangement. Then Thomas fully took over, which in some ways is a brand-new thing and in other ways is completely familiar. A lot of these kinds of transitional times a community is just trying to tread water, to keep the pieces from falling apart. And thank you to everybody who has put in so much time keeping the pieces from falling apart.\n\nBut those transitional times also give an opportunity, a chance to zoom out a bit and ask how we want to define ourselves. Not just what we stand against, not some cult of innocence pride that at least we aren’t like those people, but what do we stand for. That tension is where I will pick up more next week.\n\n## Resources\n\n### Books\n\n_Do I Stay Christian: A Guide for the Doubters, the Disappointed, and the Disillusioned_ by Brian McLaren. This is a very pastoral book taking an honest look at the concept of a Christian identity. It acknowledges a lot of very serious harms both past and present that would justifiably cause us to abandon the label. It also includes practical reasons why you may choose to keep the label despite those things, and then offers some suggestions on how to proceed either way. The main idea borrowed for this sermon was the cult of innocence. It will be used more in part two.\n\n_How To Have an Enemy: Righteous Anger and the Work of Peace_ by Melissa Florer-Bixler, a Mennonite USA pastor. This is a great examination of how Jesus responded to very real enemies and taught us to do the same.\n\n_God and Empire_ by John Dominic Crossan. This is a good overview of the Bible’s conflict between an imperial worldview and a bottom-up peace worldview. At risk of disagreeing with one of the greatest living New Testament scholars, I do think he puts Revelation in the wrong category, though, missing out on what many other scholars will point out are the nonviolent themes.\n\n### YouTube and Podcasts\n\n[Chapter, Verse, and Season from Yale Divinity School](https://yalebiblestudy.org/podcast/). This doesn’t tie a lot into the themes of this week, but I did reference it at the beginning. Since this sermon, they have now completed their 3-year trip through the lectionary.\n\n[Homebrewed Christianity](https://www.homebrewedchristianty.com/category/podcast/) has had a lot of episodes relevant here but I’ll highlight two for this half:\n\n- [Do I Stay Christian? a conversation with Brian McLaren about his new book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5J1q8iLvD08). This is the intro to a series with Brian about the book referenced above.\n- [Baptizing America: How Mainline Protestants Helped Build Christian Nationalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWghx1E67Z8). This conversation, related to a different book that I have not read, looks at how Christian nationalism has not always been a right-wing problem.\n\n## Deleted Scene - Concentric Circles\n\n[This section was a late cut to keep it fitting within my time limit. It would have come in near the end.]\n\nBuilding on the idea of a centred positive definition, not policing the boundaries, I’ve sometimes used a model from Greg Boyd and [Woodland Hills Church](https://whchurch.org/) in Minnesota that has concentric circles.\n\nAt the centre is the person of Jesus. That’s what matters most. If we’re still looking toward the person of Jesus, we’re still in the same tradition. Then there’s dogma, which is the kind of things that were defined as orthodox Christianity a long time ago in ecumenical councils and for the most part is still maintained. Then there’s doctrine, where the differences do often have practical implications but there’s a lot of room for disagreement. That might include things like whether you do infant or adult baptism. It matters, and it might even matter enough that you pick a church with that as a factor – it is hard if you are a strong believer in adult baptism and you’re in a church doing infant baptism, or vice versa – but it’s ultimately fine and maybe even good that there are both. Finally, there’s opinion, which can be interesting to talk about but doesn’t really matter in a lot of practical ways.\n\nTripp Fuller, on his podcast Homebrewed Christianity, has told a story about a youth confirmation class he taught. He inherited it as a big dogma and doctrine list to work through. But he reworked it to be a series of experiments in doing the things Jesus taught. He told the youth to write out their big theological questions throughout the course and put them in a big fishbowl, visible at the front of the room, and he promised he would get around to answering them eventually. But then he kept stalling answering them until the end after doing all these experiments. Then when they got to the end, they found nobody was still asking questions like whether Gandhi is in Hell, because they had already tried praying for their enemies. Through that experiment, they felt like they learned what they needed to know about God’s position toward those who are different. They never needed to sit and study their denomination’s doctrinal statements to have an intellectual debate. It was clear because they focused on what mattered most first.\n\nThere were similar themes in a recent Canadian Mennonite article: [Big tent, small centre | Canadian Mennonite Magazine](https://canadianmennonite.org/stories/big-tent-small-centre)\n","date":"2024-09-29T21:46:00.000Z"},"/2024/recycling-christianity/":{"id":"/2024/recycling-christianity/","title":"Recycling Christianity","description":"A sermon about Christian nationalism, identity, and being a public voice for a better way.","tags":"posts Sermon Church Politics","content":"\nThis was the second of a two-part sermon series, following up from [The Cult of Innocence](/posts/2024/cult-innocence/).\n\n## Scripture Texts\n\n[Matthew 7:1-6, 13-20](https://bibles.org/bible/1fd99b0d5841e19b-02/search?passageId=MRK.9.38-MRK.9.47&q=matthew%207%3A1-6%2C%2013-20).\n\n## Video\n\nHere's the video version from the church's YouTube:\n\n\n\n## Transcript\n\nThe transcript is cleaned up a little to be more general and shareable to the wider public. I also always end up improvising a little when I speak, so what is written down is not exactly the same as what would be captions on the video.\n\n### Previously On…\n\nFor those who weren’t here last week, this is essentially part two of last week’s sermon.\n\nA quick recap of the key points:\n\nIn the Mark text, Jesus teaches against wielding power over and against others, instead celebrating those who centre and liberate the marginalized. It was specifically children in that text, but I feel confident to make it a general statement because of everything else Jesus did and taught. He criticizes the disciples for seeking that kind of dominating power.\n\nThe cult of innocence is a term from Brian McLaren about the attitude that often supports that quest for power. That’s when we believe that we are superior to others and thus justified – maybe even required – to rule over them.\n\nThe James text gave some tips on avoiding that trap as a community: confession, singing, and praying. These help us avoid defining ourselves primarily by how we are better than somebody else and in a more positive way instead.\n\n### Defining Christianity\n\nIt’s on that question of definition that I am going to pick up. We are a Christian church. We just read from the Christian Scriptures, about the teachings of the one we call the Christ. Not everybody here would individually call themselves a Christian. No judgement from me. There’s a lot of good reasons why that might be. But “here” is a church in the Christian tradition, so I am speaking communally and assuming that at the very least, you aren’t that uncomfortable by others using the label.\n\nWhat does that mean, to define ourselves as Christian? In _Do I Stay Christian_’s introduction, Brian McLaren names several different categories under which “Christian” can be defined. He includes historically or culturally, institutionally, doctrinally, liturgically or programmatically, spiritually or experientially, moralistically, missionally, demographically, politically, socially, and linguistically. That’s a lot of options. There’s a lot of room in there to able to fit in one definitional category while being completely opposite in another category.\n\nHere’s where the conflict really comes in for me: it’s undeniable that when many people in our culture hear the word “Christian,” they picture a violent white patriarchal nationalist.\n\nI could get into a long rant about the many things I disagree with the current Christian nationalist movement about. Some of those rants have been in previous drafts of this message. But to sum up the heart of Christian nationalism, I’m going to quote one Donald Trump who said, “there should be no more important voice than the voice of Christians.” As usual for Donald Trump, that was amid some rambling that wasn’t entirely coherent, but that line was clear. It was also clear in the context that he meant white conservative Christians. They believe that they have the right to enforce a hierarchy with them at the top ruling over the rest of us, because our voices don’t matter as much. It’s running headfirst into the cult of innocence quest for power. That’s where I start to have a hard time talking about it as a truly Christian movement. It is in some of the definitional categories that McLaren names, mostly the socio-political ones. But I see no way around that it is blatantly contradictory to the way of Jesus. It is quite literally anti-Christ.\n\n### “True” Christianity\n\nSome of you might be tensing up right now at that kind of language. Most of us can probably think of some time in our life that we’ve heard that real Christians always do x, or don’t believe y. Maybe that was an attack on you personally, maybe it was a more generalized statement. You might have also heard that with more specific labels like Mennonite. Me questioning whether this is truly a Christian movement might hit a sore spot. I understand that impulse.\n\nMany years ago, there was a huge story that took over Christian social media. World Vision USA decided to allow LGBTQ people on staff. There’s not a lot of practical reasons why they wouldn’t have been allowed in the first place. It’s not like being in World Vision’s IT or letter translation or accounting has some great spiritual authority to “spread their sinful lifestyle” or whatever. But that's not my main point.\n\nIn response, thousands of evangelicals suddenly dropped support for sponsor children through World Vision. They even did that in Canada, even though World Vision Canada had never had a policy blocking LGBTQ staff in the first place. For these evangelicals, the life of the child they had spent years supporting and building a relationship with was easy to set aside. It was less important than making a culture war statement to maintain their cult of innocence as superior to LGBTQ people. And they won, at least in the short term, as World Vision USA brought back the policy after about a week of watching all their work collapse.\n\nSo, I posted on Facebook how I thought this showed some very skewed priorities. By this point, I was publicly calling myself an Anabaptist. For those who don’t know, that’s the broader branch of Christianity that Mennonites are a part of.\n\nIn response to my post, I got a message from a former pastor. He had also moved to an Anabaptist community. He let me know that I really shouldn’t be calling myself an Anabaptist if I supported any kind of LGBTQ equality. That wasn’t even the point of the post I had made, but it was also true that I did support that, so probably not worth fighting over that distinction.\n\nSo how should I respond to that?\n\n### The Options\n\nIn thinking back on that experience, I found the options that he was giving me – one he said explicitly and others I thought were there implicitly - mapped well with what McLaren named for something on the surface to be completely different. He discusses the options that were presented by the Christian colonialism project.\n\nI found this even more interesting because those options also largely map to the same options that Christian nationalists try to force on the rest of us today. There is a commonality in how this dominating power mindset works. These are the options:\n\n1. You can try to become one of them and share in the power. Maybe that’s at the cost of your integrity. There have been stories of far right talking heads who don’t really believe a lot of it, but they realized it was very profitable. Maybe in some cases it’s at the cost of other aspects of your identity, especially if that's a more marginalized identity. But you can try to play their power game. What that pastor probably wanted most was for me to renounce my heresy and return to \"true Christianity,\" willing to sacrifice LGBTQ people for my own gain.\n2. You can stick around but shut up and give them everything they want. Basically, be the subservient class that they need to exploit in order for any of their plans to actually work. For somebody to be at the top, there have to be people underneath them. Maybe I could keep using the Anabaptist label but shut up about equality. Stop rocking the boat.\n3. You can leave, at least in theory. You sometimes hear that rhetoric from the nationalists: if you don’t like the way I want my country to be, you should just leave. It’s never as easy to migrate as they seem to think it is. It’s not that easy to get into what they consider their country and not as easy to get out of their country into other countries. But maybe from that conversation I should have concluded it is best to forsake the Anabaptist label. That is what my former pastor explicitly recommended. I think he knew me enough to know I wasn’t going to do the first two, even if they did feel implied.\n4. Or the final option, when all else fails, especially if you tried to put up a fight, you can die. One of the leaders of Project 2025, writing policy for a Trump presidency, promised a revolution but that “it would be bloodless if the left wants it to be.” Essentially, he was saying he’d like everyone else to take option 2, but he’s willing to do option 4. Fortunately, this one did not feel like it was relevant in that short discussion with my former pastor.\n\n### Discerning and Judging\n\nI think the Matthew text helps point us toward having more than those four options. But it’s true that it might look self-contradictory at first.\n\nJesus says to not judge others. We are supposed to focus on our own weaknesses first and then we can gently help others with theirs.\n\nBut then we also hear to not throw pearls to pigs. That requires that you can tell what the pearls are, and who the pigs are.\n\nWe also get that there is a narrow path of life and a wide path of destruction. The way of Jesus surrendering power out of love for others is hard, but it brings life. It’s a lot easier to seek power over others. That is the default way our world operates, hence calling it the wide path, even though it leads to a lot of destruction.\n\nAnd finally, it says that we should identify false prophets by their fruit. We should ask questions like: what are the consequences of people who say they represent God or absolute truth? Do their attitudes and actions result in better loving their neighbours, particularly the most marginalized, or does it spread fear and a desire to dominate others?\n\nSo… how are we supposed to identify the “pigs” and the false prophets and those on the wide path, if we aren’t supposed to judge?\n\nI believe there are two different types of judgement involved here. The judgement in the first section is about superiority, placing ourselves above others.\n\nSo, to that, Jesus says we need to make sure we’re aware of our own weaknesses. That was last week’s message. This is an ongoing project, not a one-time thing.\n\nThen once we have some clarity, we can move into the different type of judging, which we could also call discernment. Discernment is one of those Christianese terms. We have a gifts discernment committee, which basically means volunteer recruitment.\n\nI decided to see how much consensus there was on the meaning of the word discernment, so I entered it into a Bing search. Yes, I use Bing. I will not be defending myself on that. But it gave me two definitions at the top of the results:\n\n1. The ability to judge well.\n2. (in Christian contexts) perception in the absence of judgement with a view to obtaining spiritual guidance and understanding.\n\nAnd I thought, wow, good job Bing. That second one really nailed what I was trying to say. Discernment in this sense requires the absence of judgement. If you are too caught up in a superiority complex, you can’t perceive the spiritual guidance you’re looking for. So not only do we have two different ideas of judgement here, they’re fundamentally contradictory to each other.\nThat discernment includes when societal forces are pushing in the complete opposite direction of what we see as the values of Jesus. That’s particularly true in the big central things Jesus talked about a lot, like our relationship with power over and against the marginalized.\n\nIt’s always going to be tempting to take that discernment right back into judgement. The people participating in those societal forces may be our “enemies” in that they have contrary goals. We can be honest about that. But that doesn’t mean we hate the people or that we spread fear about them. Back to the James text from last week, we restore people where we can. We get them out of their participation in the systems of oppression. We do not restore or defend the systems of oppression.\n\nI think this distinction helps set up another option for us.\n\n### Recycling Christianity\n\nThis is where I come back to that conversation with the former pastor. I did abandon the label of evangelical about that time, so why not also Anabaptist or Christian?\n\nThe big difference was that by that point, I knew a lot of Anabaptists and other Christians who clearly did not have a problem with me. Many were explicitly and publicly affirming of LGBTQ equality in the church as well as legally. Even the ones who were not fully affirming still universally agreed with me that it is bad to abandon a sponsor child just because World Vision might employ a gay person. The former pastor was the anomaly in my life.\n\nThat’s the most important part to me. It’s essentially a different angle to how last week’s message ended: we do often have to name the bad thing, but we can’t stop there. We have to be prepared to do the hard part of offering something better. Loudly. Publicly. Without any shame attached.\n\nMcLaren talks about recycling Christianity. He acknowledges that there are some harmful things that need to be thrown out; maybe there’s nothing left to be redeemed about them. But he also cautions that ideas or labels don’t simply go away. If we stop using certain language because others are using it in a harmful way, all that leaves us with is their harmful definition. So instead of abandoning Christian identity, we could seek to recycle or re-consecrate, make it holy again.\n\nThis also applies to more specific ideas in how we understand the world. The whole concept of how Christians relate to LGBTQ people had been recycled for me in time. I knew that there were options other than trying to deny them every legal right and every community participation. It made it so much easier to say “no” to that pastor because I had already said “yes” to something better.\n\nI’m going to end with a bit of a rapid fire of some of those big ideas that maybe need to be recycled. These need to be taken back from what a lot of people think is “the Christian meaning.” I don’t think it is a coincidence that a lot of these conflicts in definition go back to questions of power and the cult of innocence. Many things within the biblical and early Christian context were radically upending power structures, standing up to Roman authority. But they have since been redefined away, into justifications for why some should dominate everyone else. That’s to the point that most people – including a lot of people in churches - don’t even realize how they once meant the opposite.\n\nJustice and peace: we often hear justice talked about as punishing those we think have broken the rules. It’s justice to put somebody in jail when they’ve done something wrong. Peace is often treated as not currently having large-scale violence, mainly because you’ve enacted justice on the bad guys. That’s a very Roman Empire and European perspective. What if instead, it meant something closer to the Hebraic worldview, where justice is about making the world whole and equitable for everyone?\n\nTied into that is salvation: this is often used to mean fire insurance to avoid Hell when we die. What if instead it means what it meant in the Exodus story, and many other places in the Bible? There it’s an oppressed people escaping their oppressors, and sometimes its the oppressors escaping being involved in the systems of oppression. The Bible talks a lot about judgement but has little concern with an afterlife.\n\nApocalypse: that’s always a fun one. We often hear that spoken of as the end of the world. And usually that’s pictured as God will violently destroy the bad guys and put the good guys in charge – that’s us. Maybe that’s through a war in the Middle East, which is even more timely this week than usual. Self-fulfilling prophecy is a thing. But what if apocalypse meant what it originally meant, an unveiling? There’s a reason why the last book of English Bibles is called Revelation. It’s a poetic look behind the curtain at the forces of domination in the world and how God overcomes them.\n\nGospel: it’s supposed to mean good news but often it is phrased as very bad news. We are evil sinners who will burn in Hell if we don’t submit to the right religion. Isn’t that great news? What if it was the Gospel of Jesus instead, that God’s Kingdom of love and justice is among us right now? What if it’s the Gospel of texts like Mary’s Magnificat, that God overcomes evil including removing tyrants from their throne? Now that sounds like some good news.\n\nI have no interest in the violent white patriarchal nationalist Christianity that openly mocks the words of Jesus as “too woke.” But that recycled liberatory Christianity, the one that takes Jesus’ challenges to power seriously? That’s a Christianity I can get behind.\n\n## Resources\n\n### Books\n\n_Do I Stay Christian: A Guide for the Doubters, the Disappointed, and the Disillusioned_ by Brian McLaren.

The current season is the most directly related, but the others do tie in as well. It is perhaps my most recommended Christian podcast.\n\n[For Our Daughters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkES4X_qb6c) is a short documentary from Kristen K Du Mez, author of Jesus and John Wayne (listed above under Books).

This is a pretty good summary of major points of Project 2025, the policy manifesto of the US right. Also available ad-free with a [Nebula](https://nebula.tv/featured) subscription. It isn’t a Christian refutation of it, but a US legal one.\n\n## Other Possible Texts\n\nUnlike the first week, this week wasn’t based on the lectionary, and the idea really came from extending last week’s text, so I needed to select at least one more Scripture text that tied in for this week. I ultimately selected the Matthew text, but these are others I considered.\n\n[1 John 4](https://bibles.org/bible/1fd99b0d5841e19b-02/1JN.4?passageId=1JN.4.1-1JN.4.10&q=1%20john%204): this shares some similarities with the Matthew text from the Sermon on the Mount. It similarly names that there are false prophets. Matthew says they are known by their fruit; this says they are known by denying that Jesus is from God. I think this is saying a similar thing. If you believe Jesus is from God, you believe he has some authority in his wisdom teaching about surrendering power out of love for others. I didn’t feel like I could get to the point as quickly as with the Matthew text.\n\nThere were a couple more in the same category of identifying false teachers:\n\n- [2 Peter 2](https://bibles.org/bible/1fd99b0d5841e19b-02/2PE.2?passageId=2PE.2.1-2PE.2.10&q=2%20peter%202): this one is the most angry about false teachers but didn’t have as clear of a dichotomy for the alternative, which I wanted.\n- [2 Timothy 4:1-5](https://bibles.org/bible/1fd99b0d5841e19b-02/2TI.4?passageId=2TI.4.1-2TI.4.5&q=2%20Timothy%204%3A1-5): a shorter segment acknowledging how false teachers will lure people in with attractive myths – like the superiority of your group over others – but is mostly focused on doing the hard work of building an alternative.\n\n[Acts 5:33-42](https://bibles.org/bible/1fd99b0d5841e19b-02/ACT.5?passageId=ACT.5.33-ACT.5.42&q=Acts%205%3A33-42): the argument of Gamaliel here is interesting, and at least partly coherent with how I am approaching Christian nationalism. Distance ourselves from them. Make it clear that there is a distinction. But it’s not actively seeking to kill them, instead trusting that if it is not truly from God it will not work out well for them in the end.\n\n[Ephesians 6:10-17](https://bibles.org/bible/1fd99b0d5841e19b-02/EPH.6?passageId=EPH.6.10-EPH.6.17&q=Ephesians%206%3A10-17). This is a lot of spiritual warfare language which often makes those of us in the peace tradition uncomfortable, but the key part to me is verse 12, that “we aren’t fighting against human enemies but against rulers, authorities, forces of cosmic darkness, and spiritual powers of evil in the heavens” (CEB). I think this is helpful to remember that while we cannot divide the world between us good guys and those bad guys, we also can’t deny that evil systems exist, and the way of Jesus stands in opposition to them. I am tempted to do a “recycling” sermon on the concept of spiritual warfare at some point. Update: I am now doing a sermon on this text in an upcoming Ephesians series.\n\n[Acts 8:9-23](https://bibles.org/bible/1fd99b0d5841e19b-02/ACT.8?passageId=ACT.8.9-ACT.8.18&q=Acts%208%3A9-23): see the deleted scene “Simon the Great” below.\n\n## Deleted Scenes\n\nThese are some pieces that got cut for time, but are a direction I went down at some point during the process.\n\n### More Examples of Christian Nationalism\n\n[I ultimately cut this down because I think the core of Christian nationalism was clear enough that I didn’t need multiple quotes about it, which would have taken time away from what we do about it. Some of this did get included in a shorter form.]\n\nYou might have heard news recently of Project 2025, the policy document associated with but not directly a part of the Trump campaign. It started gaining a lot of attention after one of its leaders made a comment that sounded very similar to the options for subjects of colonial Christianity. He promised that they would bring about a new American Revolution, but it would be bloodless “if the Left wants it to be.” He wants the Left to take option 2, to shut up and not fight back, but he’s willing to go to option 4.\n\nRecently, a post came across my social media feed from a man who wrote a book in defence of Christian nationalism. His tweet, or whatever they’re called now, says, “Christianity – as the true religion affirming what is true, good and beautiful – commands you to love all but to prefer your people over other people.” If you don’t know anything about Christianity except what the nationalists say, you might think, oh, ok. But if you’ve heard anything from the Sermon on the Mount, or the Good Samaritan, or any of Paul’s many writings about breaking down divisions in the church, or lots of other biblical texts as well as historical teaching, you’re just left saying “what are you talking about?” It’s not even logically possible when you think about it. What exactly does love even mean if you are saying to somebody that you “love” that in all practical ways you prefer them less?\n\nAnother recent quote that stood out to me was from Donald Trump himself. In a call with the National Faith Advisory Board, he said:\n\n> Every day, she’s [Kamala Harris] flooding our country with millions and millions of criminal illegal aliens. And wants, to make them citizens, she wants to have them vote, which will destroy the voting powers of Christian conservatives forever. And once that starts happening, and once you get those numbers involved, you lose everything that you’ve had. You’ve had more than you had now, but we’re going to get it higher than ever before. There’s no more, and there should be no more important voice than the voice of Christians.\n\nA lot of that is his trademark incoherence and I don’t really know what he meant. There’s also obviously a lot that is just factually incorrect. But he did get across a couple of his key points.\n\n1. Conservative Christians should be operating out of fear that they are going to lose what power they had. And I think one of the incoherent bits is supposed to be him walking the line that they should be afraid of losing what they have while also feeding the martyr complex which says they already have no power. That’s part of a particular cult of innocence, that they simultaneously believe they should have all the power while denying any power they already have.\n2. Conservative Christians should have the most important voice. And that means white conservative Christians. A lot of the immigrants to the US that he is so scared of are conservative Christians, just not white ones.\n\nOur political rhetoric in Canada does not usually get as direct as these three quotes, which is why I’m leaned heavily on US examples. We have a lot of the same mindset, but usually our politicians won’t go as far as to directly say that conservative white Christians should have more power over and against everyone else. At most we usually get some vague references to Christian heritage, while letting the more extreme churches or other groups go ahead with the direct language. But as is often true, we are not that far behind the US on this. Even five years ago American politicians also didn’t explicitly declare themselves Christian nationalists the way they do now, so all signs are still suggesting that there are significant forces pushing us in that direction as well.\n\n### Simon the Great\n\nUsing [Acts 8:9-23](https://bibles.org/bible/1fd99b0d5841e19b-02/ACT.8?passageId=ACT.8.9-ACT.8.18&q=Acts%208%3A9-23) as a second Scripture reading:\n\nIt was hard to come up with a Scripture text for the category of those using the Jesus name for selfish power-seeking reasons. There’s a practical reason for that. The Scriptural canon only includes text up to about the end of the first century, which was a couple of centuries before Christians had much cultural or political power.\n\nBut I did think of the story of Simon the Great in Acts 8. He is first established as being a powerful magician, earning the name the Great. He comes to believe in and preach the message of Jesus. But like the disciples in the Mark text last week, it seems like he hasn’t quite understood some of Jesus’ counter-cultural messages about power. When he sees Peter and John doing miraculous things, he wants to buy the Holy Spirit’s power. Peter’s response is harsh. He rebukes him for his belief that God’s gifts can be bought with money. God is not concerned with helping the powerful become even more powerful, and Peter calls out Simon’s “wicked intent” to make the Holy Spirit a tool for his power.\n\nSimon is a bit like the modern Christian nationalists. He has the language of Christianity, maybe even sincerely believes a lot of it, but primarily because he thinks he can use it to amass more power. He’s still missing a huge part of the Jesus message that upends his whole concept of power.\n\n### Rockway Constitution\n\n[This was meant to help remind more of the themes from the previous week, that we are not immune to nationalist and cult of innocent attitudes.]\n\nAnd, as I talked about last week, we are also wrong if we have that cult of innocence attitude, even if it is to accomplish completely different policy goals.\n\nThomas (our pastor) knew roughly what I was going to speak about these two weeks, and he sent me the 1982 constitution of Rockway because he saw a line in there that stood out to him. Under the heading of Evangelism / Social Concerns, it says the church “shall actively endeavour to bring spiritual healing and nourishment both to those within and outside its numbers” – ok - and that we “shall work toward the achievement of Christian standards of social conditions locally, nationally, and internationally.” This church, at its founding, clearly believed that “Christian standards” was something worth sharing, that there was some way that Christianity was meant to be an influence in the world.\n\nWhat that section doesn’t answer is the important part to me: how? How do we go about spreading Christian “standards”? “Standards” is the specific wording that jumped out to me and probably to a lot of you. Something like wisdom teaching or even ethical principles I would be able to swallow a bit more. Standards maybe conveys a bit more uniformity and a bit more legalism, that these are the rules we all have to follow, and in this context, that might imply that we want to force others to follow. But that’s reading a lot into one word written 40 years ago.\n\nThere is a little bit promising in another section, emphasizing that the church is a voluntary community. If you put the two together, that means that the spreading of those Christian standards can’t be done by force or coercion, and that is traditionally the Mennonite position at least on paper. But I didn’t see anywhere that described how it would be done instead.\n\n### Pearls and Pigs\n\n[In my quick breakdown of the Matthew text, I briefly had a longer tangent on the pearls before swine part.]\n\n“They will stomp on the pearls, then turn around and attack you” is an interesting aspect. Sometimes when you try to give a good thing to somebody, they don’t appreciate it. They might even get angry and take it out on you. I wonder if it is stretching the metaphor too much to ponder if the pearls thrown to the pigs are things like the terminology of “Christian”? When I hear Christian nationalists demanding that they are the real Christians, then also shutting down and threatening anybody who dares to point out how Jesus and the Bible seem to disagree with them a lot, that seems to line up to me with what Jesus says here. It sounds a lot like them stomping on the pearls of Jesus’ wisdom teaching, turning around, and attacking you for daring to invite them into it.\n\n### Staying Defiantly\n\n[This was the hardest part to cut, as I wanted to lean in more on the importance of offering an alternative loudly. But ultimately I needed to cut some time and I did get to some of this more quickly.]\n\nOne phrase that McLaren used for this is “staying defiantly.” That phrase stuck with me: staying defiantly.\nWhen we are wrestling with what to do with Christian identity, we often act like there are two choices:\n\n1. We can leave defiantly, declaring that we just can’t be a part of this anymore. McLaren doesn’t blame you if you take this option, especially if you are one who is being attacked and marginalized.\n2. We can stay compliantly, shutting up about any problems we see.\n\nThose line up with a couple of the colonialism options from earlier.\n\nMcLaren quotes from Kristin K Du Mez – whose book _Jesus and John Wayne_ I also recommend - that whether you stay or leave Christianity, you should do so loudly, especially if you have some privilege to lend:\n\n> Silence in leaving or remaining will only allow those patterns to persist. It is long past time for white Christians to call out injustice, bigotry, violent rhetoric, disparaging language, racism, misogyny, abuse of power, and the idolatry of Christian nationalism in their own communities, even if doing so comes at a cost. The cost of not doing so is undeniable, and it is a cost largely born by others.\n\nWe are not talking about being the quiet in the land here. We’re talking about being loud, being defiant.\n\n### US Politics Parallels\n\nSomething strange happened after I started formulating this pair of sermons: I started seeing a lot of my key points paralleled in US politics. After thinking a lot about how we need to be able to stay defiantly, keeping a Christian identity while challenging those abusing that label, Joe Biden announced he wouldn’t run again, and Kamala Harris took over as the Democratic candidate. Soon after, a particular strategy started among Democrats: calling the extreme right, who control most of the Republican party now, weird.\n\nA lot of those politicians have spent a long time defining themselves as the real Americans (or the real Canadians) – which is mostly just code for white. At the same time, they have been embracing more and more extreme positions that are actually very unpopular. It’s weird to want to imprison women for medical care, it’s weird to want to ban birth control, it’s weird to want the President to be able to break any laws he wants as long as the Supreme Court is part of the same powerful inner circle, it’s weird to think that the election was stolen simply because your side lost, it’s weird to promise to be a dictator on day one, it’s weird to pledge to fire any civil servant who is not sufficiently loyal to their dear leader, it’s weird to spread lies about immigrants eating pets… Wait, sorry, I said earlier that I wasn’t going to have time for all those details, so I’ll just say, yeah, that’s weird.\n\nAnd Democrats have done similar with trying to reclaim some other words like freedom, which has been largely defined by the right wing for years as the freedom for those with power to do whatever they want to those without power.\n\nI think staying defiantly is also very similar to Jesus’ wisdom teachings around turning the other cheek. Without going into the details of that, Jesus was not saying to roll over and give people what they want. It was a way to draw attention to an injustice without perpetuating a cycle of violence. This feels a lot like that, simply declaring in a plain easy to understand way that yeah, some of this is really weird and really unpopular and doing a lot of harm and we don’t have to keep pretending otherwise.\n\nUpdate as I post this online, after the election: this strategy mostly went away. I'm not going to speculate too much on whether that would have made a difference in the result. My point still stands that as Christians, we need to do that defiant reclaiming of definitions.\n\n### World Communion Sunday\n\nThis week is normally World Communion Sunday. It’s a day when most Christian churches around the world all participate in the communion ritual and there is often some emphasis on how despite all our differences, we are all a part of this Jesus tradition.\nFor some practical reasons we are celebrating it but in a couple of weeks, not actually lining up with everybody else. I preached on that last year. Part of what I said is that while there are lots of food traditions in other religions and cultures, our Communion celebration is a celebration of the particularity of the Jesus tradition.\n\nThat includes many that call themselves Christian nationalists or other behaviours that we would consider antithetical to the way of Jesus. That introduces some tension with what I’ve said today. How do we celebrate and remember our unity with these other movements, when we are also trying to detach ourselves from them, to paint an alternative? I don’t think that’s a tension we can simply ignore. If we lean entirely into the unity, we are staying quietly, failing to challenge the injustices that we absolutely must challenge. If we rush to cut them off, we risk minimizing the harms being done as well as digging ourselves deeper into a cult of innocence. So, we need to be able to maintain that yes, this Christian tradition that we are a part of has a lot of baggage both past and present, while doing what we can to embody other ways of being within that tradition.\n\n### Recycling Actions and Terms\n\n[I initially had some more examples of some simple practical actions that embodied some “recycling” as well as some more ideas that might need recycling.]\n\nA very simple example: back in the spring we did the blessing of the bicycles. I took a couple of pictures of our overloaded bike stands and of Thomas doing the blessing. I shared some on my social media. I got some likes as expected from some progressive Christians. I also got a couple of replies along the lines of “I have no interest in religion but this is pretty cool.” It was a little drop in the bucket, but it was a counterpoint to what people often think “Christian” means.\n\nOr another transit-related one from another local church. When I’m not biking home, I’m usually taking the bus, catching it right beside a United Church. There’s no bench or shelter at that stop. At some point this summer, a pair of lawn chairs appeared, chained to the tree, so those of us waiting for a bus could sit down. It’s also common to see unhoused people sheltering under the overhang there, and I have sheltered there myself when it is raining or really hot. I don’t believe they offer that because they wanted their church to look good. I believe they saw an opportunity to use their property to publicly love their neighbours. But like our bicycle blessing, it made me happy to be reminded that churches like that exist. And that only happens when those loving actions are happening in public.\n\nA common one is putting up a rainbow flag on a church. This has happened enough, at least in cities in Ontario, that I think it has achieved some of the “recycling” I talked about. I think those churches are often still thought of as “not real Christianity,” but it is still a step in the right direction that a lot of people now know that there are a lot of churches who are fully affirming of LGBTQ people.\n\nResurrection: that might be used to sound like our bodies don’t matter, because once we die, we’ll ascend into Heaven. But that’s not what resurrection means! It’s not the same thing as ascension. A resurrection requires the redemption of physical bodies.\n\nRuling over the Earth, or dominion over the Earth: we might hear language like that to imply that we should pillage and destroy everything for short-term profit, because God put us in charge! It all exists for our pleasure! What if it meant that we should rule like Jesus did, willing to even sacrifice of ourselves for the good of others and the planet?\n","date":"2024-10-06T21:46:00.000Z"},"/2024/remembrance-day/":{"id":"/2024/remembrance-day/","title":"To Remember Is To Work for Peace","description":"Some reflections on Remembrance Day as a believer in the peace church tradition.","tags":"posts Politics","content":"\nRemembrance Day often carries two different tones with it:\n\n1. War is horrible. We honour those who died by grieving that horror with all its lost lives.\n2. War is super important and we need our national team to win, so support our troops and cheer when they do more violence than the other side does.\n\nAnabaptists like myself are mostly ok with the first part. We hold in high esteem those who would sacrifice their lives for others. The only real question is how many soldiers really choose to sacrifice their lives, rather than being pushed to by nationalist forces who stand to gain. If it isn't chosen then it isn't really a sacrifice on their part. It is often more accurate to say that some politicians and war profiteers sacrificed those soldiers' lives for their profit. But I digress.\n\nIt's the second part that we start to have a problem with Remembrance Day. Anabaptists remain firm that our loyalty is to Jesus, not to any nation, and Jesus is pretty clear about the whole nonviolent love of enemies thing. So grieving violence makes complete sense. The nationalist jingoism, the cheerleading of violence as long as it is against THEM instead of against US, does not.\n\nFor several years, Mennonites have often worn a red pin that says \"To remember is to work for peace.\" That might be in addition to the poppy (if we're focusing more on the first part above) or instead of (if we're focusing more on the second part). Either way, this is the most essential part in my worldview: if you truly grieve wars and violence more generally, if you truly want to remember and honour those who died, you will want to work to keep that from happening again whether that's in Ukraine or Canada or Palestine or anywhere else. Being a peacemaker is not a simple opting out of violence; it must be an active work toward a more just and whole world.\n\nThat's my quick reflection of the day. Here's Marlene Epp speaking at my church, Rockway Mennonite, about some of the history of Mennonites with Remembrance Day:\n\n\n","date":"2024-11-11T21:46:00.000Z"},"/2024/ambs-challenging-christian-nationalism/":{"id":"/2024/ambs-challenging-christian-nationalism/","title":"AMBS: Challenging Christian Nationalism","description":"A little before the US election, Anabaptist Mennonite Biblical Seminary held a great discussion of Christian nationalism.","tags":"posts Politics","content":"\nSee below for a great presentation at Anabaptist Mennonite Biblical Seminary about Christian Nationalism.

I have perhaps a more charitable interpretation.","tags":"posts Technology Politics","content":"\nA common sentiment is that in the modern world, people are too stuck in their echo chambers. This is mostly used as an insult against the extremely online left wing, most recently a lot about [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/). Interestingly, the extremely online right wing doesn't get the same accusation as much, even though they're steeped in much more extreme networks. But that's an immediate tangent.\n\n## The Bad Faith Version\n\nMany of the people talking about this are doing so in bad faith. They seem to mean that for some reason those with more left political leanings are obligated to give all of their time, money, and data to a far-right billionaire and his network that has been actively suppressing them and sending harassment at them for years. Let's be clear that's bad. You have a right to block somebody who walks in to your social feeds and starts hurling abuse at you or at anyone else, just as much as you have a right to kick out somebody who tries to walk into living room and commit the same abuses in person.\n\nEven more to the point, some people absolutely should be blocked because they are often actively trying to drive engagement through anger, which benefits them, including sometimes financially. Don't try to dunk on them first. Just take away their precious engagement and let them shout into the void. Make it less profitable to be spreading hate and maybe some of them will even learn to stop spreading hate.\n\nFurthermore, am extremist billionaire does not have the right to demand that more people buy ads from him or use his network just because he wants them to. We are under no such obligation to make him even richer. We are under no such obligation to support his false claims that he has turned X into the beacon of free speech.\n\nBut there have been plenty of responses already on the Internet pointing out things like this.\n\n## The Good Faith Version\n\nWhere this gets more interesting is that I'm not convinced that's what everybody means when they criticize echo chambers. I believe some do have a more good faith desire behind the complaint, even if they aren't explaining it in quite the way I am about to.\n\nA lot of the complaints say they want to restore respectful dialogue with people we don't agree with everything about. On its surface, that is a good goal.\n\nUnfortunately that is not what social media is built to be. It is not designed to have that respectful deep dialogue. Messages are short, struggling to find space for nuance. They are mostly one-directional; one of the interesting changes years ago was shifting from social networking to social media. Networking implies some equality and finding your peers. Media implies there are some creators and the rest are consumers. That's a dynamic that is very hard to have real hard conversation within. Social media may occasionally be able to put a band-aid on loneliness, but it isn't a replacement for real community.\n\nSo I think the good faith interpretation here is that people are realizing that social media is not a replacement for real community and they want that real community again. Where they make a mistake is thinking the way to get it again is by forcing everyone to be on a particular toxic site.\n\n## The Emerging Church and Dialogue\n\nLet's get this back to the realm of Christianity. I recently listened through [the Emerged series from Homebrewed Christianity](https://www.homebrewedchristianty.com/2023/10/16/the-story-of-the-emerging-church-movement/), looking back on the emerging church movement. This was a big movement for my own life, although I was not tied to any official part of that movement and was largely at the end of it. But something that came up a lot resonated with my experience: it was largely based in friendship. You could have extensive tough conversations with people completely different than you, sometimes coming to very different conclusions, because of a friendship that came from wrestling with the same questions over time. In the earliest days, that was in small meetup groups you would find online, and show up without any idea of who else would be there. You might show up and see an evangelical youth pastor hoping nobody from his church sees him, and a 16 year old Episcopalian contemplating faith for the first time, and a 70 year old Eastern Orthodox priest who wants to learn more about younger generations.\n\nLater, closer to my time, a lot of these conversations happened in blogs. We found our 20 or 30 blogs that we loved, loaded them in our Google Reader (which no longer exists but RSS still does), and we would have long and tough conversations with a lot of the same people over months and years in the comments or through writing our own blog posts.\n\nThose largely faded out as social media took over, which gets us back to the problems I named earlier. There are some places somewhat modelling those ideas of dialogue in longer deeper discussions with those you don't fully agree with, like the [New Leaf Network](https://www.newleafnetwork.ca/) here in Canada, but the large scale movement is no more.\n\n## What Now?\n\nSo what do we do about that? Personally, I think trying to change the nature of social media is swimming upstream. You might occasionally manage to foster some real respectful conversation with somebody you disagree with. But it's hard because the medium fundamentally opposes it. It's even harder when there's a profit motive for the rich people controlling the social media to maximum their profits at the expense of everything else, which largely means optimizing engagement through rage and blocking links out to reliable sources.\n\nWe could try to go back to blogs, if we're going to focus on tech. Hey look, I'm sort of doing that, but without comments - less because I don't want dialogue and more because I don't want to pay for and maintain a server. But I suspect it's still too close to social media for most people to be able to change their default ways of thinking, so many now will still walk into the comments ready to pick a fight, not form a community over the next decade.\n\nSo this is where I sound old-fashioned: churches need to be building real community, in person or online small groups. And they need to be inviting others into that real community. That real community takes a lot of time, it takes a lot of patience with each other, it takes a willingness to confess when we've hurt each other and lot of forgiveness when we do mess up. It also takes intentional infrastructure: where can they meet in a place that is reachable, which is not a given in North America's sprawling urban design? What time, when so many people have no time left at the end of a workday to commit to something else? Those don't have easy answers. But if we aren't even trying, our social problems are only to get worse.\n","date":"2024-11-24T21:46:00.000Z"},"/2024/distractions/":{"id":"/2024/distractions/","title":"On Political Distractions","description":"Musings around the common social media claims about distractions in politics.","tags":"posts Politics","content":"\nLike with [the \"echo chamber\" discourse](/posts/2024/echo-chambers/), I think there's something deeper in the \"distractions\" discourse on social media than it appears at first.\n\nFor those unaware, this is how it goes: politician (sometimes other public figure) does a new bad thing while being known to do other bad things, and social media erupts with a debate about whether the new bad thing is a distraction from the other bad things.\n\n## What Does That Mean?\n\nIt is rarely explained what they think it means that something is a distraction. It often just gets labelled a distraction as if it is obvious. But my best guesses at how it is usually interpreted:\n\nSome definitely think it means a cold calculated tactic, that the politician is intentionally starting another bad thing so that you'll stop talking about the other bad thing. The theory is that they can get away with the new bad thing more than the old bad thing, so once everyone's attention goes to the new bad thing, they'll end up getting away with both. This is probably sometimes true but I don't think as often as social media tends to believe.\n\nMaybe more often true is a softer version, more like: politician knows that they won't get away with all the bad things, so they throw as many as they can against the wall and hope some of it sticks. Trump has talked (or had ghost written) to this effect: always ask for the absolute maximum, then you may end up appearing to \"compromise\" and still getting everything you really wanted. I am somewhat optimistic that's what is happening with his tariff promise, that he's making absurd demands and then will \"compromise\" at very close to the status quo except for one thing he can claim as a political win without actually helping anyone. That's how the last NAFTA renegotiation went, when it came back basically the same as before except he got to call it a new name and declared a huge victory.\n\n## Burned Out\n\nAnyway, to get to the main point, what I suspect people are really trying to say when they declare something a distraction is often more like: I'm overwhelmed and I cannot fight all of these battles at once so I need to opt out of this one. And that is a very important discussion to have.\n\nThe nature of social media is that it is good for blasting out and consuming a lot of news in little bursts at a time. Pair that with the extremely online left, where it is easy to be stuck digging deeper and deeper into one piece of bad news after another, and it is inevitable that eventually you throw up your hands and declare that it is all too much for one person to handle.\n\nIt is too much for one person to handle. It's true. I cannot fix all the world's problems on my own. I can't even fully understand all the world's problems on my own. But here's the important thing: I don't have to do it all on my own. Neither do you.\n\nSometimes I think about the modern extremely online left's emphases on ideas like \"justice isn't justice if it isn't for everyone.\" That's true, but it can have a paralyzing effect where nobody does anything because we're all too afraid that we didn't sufficiently account for all of humanity in our 280 character post. It's an all or nothing attitude when none of us are capable of doing it all. Sometimes we need to move forward the best we can, get some of it right and some wrong, then take feedback, then move forward again with that feedback in mind so that we get a little bit less wrong.\n\nWe need to be better at finding the one or two or three things we are going to really focus on, and maybe stay loosely aware of the rest, particularly in how that might impact your few. But for the rest of the constant barrage of issues we are being reminded of, we often need to take a deep breath and decide to trust that somebody else is going to fight that fight while you're fighting your fight. You can't do it all. That's ok. Maybe the new thing is a distraction for you and the work that you need to prioritize. You might need to say no to some things because you already said yes to a more important (to you) thing. Just be careful about projecting that onto everyone else, lest you end up discouraging those for whom it is their important work.\n","date":"2024-11-30T21:46:00.000Z"},"/2024/hope-sewer-rat/":{"id":"/2024/hope-sewer-rat/","title":"Hope is a Sewer Rat","description":"A poem about hope as a sewer rat, not as a bird.","tags":"posts","content":"\nI love this poem I've seen go around social media a couple of times, called Hope is a Sewer Rat by Caitlin Seida.\n\n> Hope is not the thing with feathers\n> That comes home to roost\n> When you need it most.\n>\n> Hope is an ugly thing\n> With teeth and claws and\n> Patchy fur that’s seen some shit.\n>\n> It’s what thrives in the discards\n> And survives in the ugliest parts of our world,\n> Able to find a way to go on\n> When nothing else can even find a way in.\n>\n> It’s the gritty, nasty little carrier of such\n> diseases as\n> optimism, persistence,\n> Perseverance and joy,\n> Transmissible as it drags its tail across\n> your path\n> and\n> bites you in the ass.\n>\n> Hope is not some delicate, beautiful bird,\n> Emily.\n> It’s a lowly little sewer rat\n> That snorts pesticides like they were\n> Lines of coke and still\n> Shows up on time to work the next day\n> Looking no worse for wear.\n\nMaybe sometimes hope actually is the delicate bird that arrives just when you need it and reminds you of a better world.

Here's how I think about things like my context, Scripture, and its role in the service.","tags":"posts Church","content":"\nI recently joined [a New Leaf Network class on Preaching in a Post-Evangelical World](https://www.newleafnetwork.ca/store/postevangelicalpreaching). I only preach 1-2 times a year, and in [a church](https://rockwaymc.ca) that would not typically be described as post-evangelical or any other kind of evangelical, but I still find the topic very interesting and I anticipated correctly that they would still be talking through some relevant questions.\n\nI'm not going to recap everything they talked about, but will use it as a launching pad to touch on some of the main considerations I have when I am preaching:\n\n## Audience Context\n\nThey talk a lot in the New Leaf class about knowing your audience context. What you say to a mostly privileged church needs to be very different than what you say to a poorer, less educated, or otherwise oppressed church. My church? It's mostly privileged: not quite all white most weeks, mostly pretty solidly middle class, highly educated, mostly cis and straight, mostly married, mostly able-bodied, average age probably in their 60s. I am also mostly privileged. When I preach at my church, I am speaking from that perspective, as somebody wrestling with using my own privilege well and trying to help others do the same. So I do end up talking about things like systemic racism, or more broadly the need to acknowledge our sin. I wouldn't do that, or at least not in nearly the same way, with a majority Black or poor church. They know the world is broken; they experience it every day. They don't need that spoken to them. They probably need a lot more of a reminder of how God is with them in that oppression and we have hope that God will bring justice in all the practical ways to restore them as equal members of society.\n\nOne of the weird parts of considering audience context is being published widely to the Internet. When I write something to say, I'm writing it for my context. A lot of others share that context, and I hope if they stumble across it on this site or the church's site or YouTube that it will help them, and I do believe strongly that in almost all circumstances a church's sermons should be available publicly as an entry point for somebody wanting to check it out and learn more about the community. But it does also mean others with very different contexts can find it and it might be the exact opposite message of what they need to hear right now. That can be mediated a little by making my context as clear as I can, but it will always be true that one message can't be perfect for everyone in all contexts at the same time.\n\n## Expository Preaching\n\nIn the New Leaf class, they talk about expository as the default approach to preaching in evangelical circles. This approach that is very much focused on walking through the text, helping explain it generally in the order it appears, as opposed to a more topical approach that starts from a current relevant question. It has some big advantages mainly that it keeps the text a little more in its context.\n\nI skew a little more expository than most in my church, but still not a lot compared to a lot of evangelicals. I mostly think it's hard to do really well in a meaningful way in a 15-20 sermon slot, at least not without being part of a longer series or being connected to Adult Education for more help. There just isn't time to go really deep into Scriptural context. There are exceptions: the first in my recent double header was much more expository, and I will have the final piece of a series on Ephesians that will likely end up a bit more expository. The New Leaf session touches on some of the problem with expository as well, that it often ends up arrogantly projecting what we want into the text, while pretending we're letting it speak for itself, because we do have a social context which does impact our reading whether we like to admit it or not. There is really no such thing as \"letting the text speak for itself\"; we're always interpreting. But if you're able to still come in with that honesty about your perspective, then yes, I think it is valuable to have some sermons that start from the text and some that start from the topic.\n\n## Is It Antiquated?\n\nNew Leaf's class raises the point that a lot of people think of preaching as an antiquated form. Having one person speak and others listen is not a very good way to learn. So why do we still do it? Several years ago, one member of our church preached on why he preached, and he essentially said that while only hearing something is bad for learning it, formulating your thoughts enough to be able to preach it is a very good way to learn or wrestle with something. So preaching is good for the preacher at least, if they're being honest in their wrestling.\n\nThat is close to what I'm often going for now when I preach: I want to model wrestling with the Scripture text and our tradition and our current world, and invite others into that wrestling. They don't have to conclude the same on whatever topic as I do. I don't care about that. But I do care that they are called into the kind of community that is willing to wrestle through the hard parts of life together.\n\nThat's also where I see the difference in preaching and teaching. Teaching is a fairly intellectual lecture or discussion getting deep into a specific issue, and in our church the Adult Education hour does that more. Preaching is more about inviting each other into a community around Jesus. That requires a lot more humility than the approach where the preacher is declaring God's perfect truth, and it probably takes more of a community where preaching duties are more shared in order to avoid only hearing one voice, but it's much more powerful.\n\n## The Role of the Sermon\n\nSo the sermon is valuable, but it probably shouldn't be the absolute only thing that matters. I'm a big proponent on doing the Eucharist/communion regularly, that embodied act of remembering the Jesus story together in an extremely tangible way. I personally do not care as much about music, but I know a lot do. I'm also a big fan of communal prayer, sharing our thanks and requests together.\n\nI think sermons are often important, especially as an entry point for somebody who is new. It is the most opportunity to clearly convey what the community thinks this whole Jesus thing is about, and we live in a world where a lot of people no longer have any idea what this Jesus thing is about. So I especially want to preserve the sermon on days like Easter or leading up to Christmas, when people are most likely to come for the first time, or the first time in a while.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean it has to be the central feature of every service. It doesn't even mean that it has to be present in every service. On the opposite end from Easter may be something like Thanksgiving, at least in our church: a lot of people are away, and if they are there they are likely tired juggling family commitments, there is highly unlikely to be anybody new showing up, and while gratitude broadly is certainly coherent with Christianity Thanksgiving is not a specifically Christian holiday. So that day, our church usually doesn't have a sermon, instead replacing it with a day of singing and poems. It allows for a more meditative space, which is a valuable change of pace.\n","date":"2024-12-08T11:46:00.000Z"},"/2024/shiphrah-puah-moses/":{"id":"/2024/shiphrah-puah-moses/","title":"Shiphrah, Puah, and Moses","description":"There's an interesting contrast in the stories of Exodus 1 and Exodus 2 and how different characters respond to injustice.","tags":"posts Bible","content":"\nI occasionally think about the contrast of the first two chapters of Exodus.\n\nIn chapter 1, Shiphrah and Puah were midwives who were ordered to kill Hebrew babies. But they don't do it, instead claiming Hebrew women gave birth before they could get there. They undermined the system, saving a lot of lives.\n\nIn chapter 2, Moses, raised in palace privilege because of a different bit of quiet courage from another couple women, sees a slaver beating a Hebrew. He gets mad, kills him, then has to go into hiding.\n\nThe role of privilege here does matter, I think. Moses grew up in the palace. He has probably always been taught that the way to enact change is to wield your strength against those who need to be kept in line. So when he sees an Egyptian beating a Hebrew and gets angry, that's how he responds: wielding his power violently. Then he is surprised to learn that the Hebrew slaves were not excited by this display of dominance; they are afraid that he'll do the same to them.\n\nOf course Moses eventually becomes the movie-style hero that is the symbol of the Exodus. But first he has to spend an entire generation in exile, surrendering the privilege and domination mindset he had, encountering God, and waiting for the people who were trying to kill him to die off. And in that time, \"the Israelites were still groaning\" (CEB) in slavery, who maybe could have been helped if he shown some wisdom earlier.\n\nI recently watched the first Hobbit movie again, and was struck by this bit of Tolkien wisdom about power:\n\n> Saruman believes that it is only great power that can hold evil in check. But that is not what I have found. I've found it is the small things, everyday deeds of ordinary folk that keeps the darkness at bay. Simple acts of kindness and love.\n\nThere's at least one big difference from the Exodus context, and the Hobbit context, compared to my context and likely the context of most readers: unlike Egypt at this time, we live in a democracy. We have more ability to directly oppose evil with freedom of expression. And we definitely need a lot of people in that category, explicitly countering harm.\n\nBut I think we also need the Shiphrahs and the Puahs, those who will quietly throw a stick into the gears of the death machine, saving a lot of lives in the process even if nobody seems to notice.\n","date":"2024-12-10T19:04:00.000Z"},"/2025/empathetic-imagination/":{"id":"/2025/empathetic-imagination/","title":"Empathetic Imagination","description":"Musings on the phrase empathetic imagination and how it applies to movies, politics, and web development.","tags":"posts Technology Politics","content":"\nI heard a phrase recently that has stuck with me: \"empathetic imagination.\"\n\n## Movies and Empathetic Storytelling\n\nThis was on a movie podcast, which might not seem like the most obvious spot for a line about empathy that stuck out to me like this. But this podcast, named tongue in cheek The Only Podcast About Movies, is primarily approaching movies from the question of what the movie wants to say about the world. Storytelling is powerful, with movies being one of our greatest mediums at the moment, and one particular way it is powerful is in building empathy for stories that are different than yours.\n\nThis is the main reason why I do appreciate good TV and movies so much. I am also interested in technical excellence in directing or acting or effects or any number of other elements of a movie. But primarily, I am interested in movies that tell a good story about people who are different than me in some way learning and growing. I want a movie to help me imagine the world being a little bit different.\n\nIt's also, to jump to a different medium, whey I always play video games with female characters and with non-human characters when given the choice. I'm a human male in real life and the majority of stories are about people like me. It's a little bit boring to do that all the time. If I have a chance to try to see the world in a slightly different way, I want to take it. I'm very confused by certain elements of gamer culture that opposes the very existence of female characters.\n\n## Empathy and Politics\n\nThe context for the empathetic imagination comment was after the US election, and one of the hosts was lamenting the lack of empathetic imagination that made the result possible. He found it extremely discouraging that so few people could imagine how their voting choices would hurt the most vulnerable around them. I think that's an important insight.\n\nCarol Off, in her book _At A Loss For Words_, tells a story about speaking to a member of one of Canada's \"freedom convoys.\" Off asked what \"freedom\" meant to this convoy member, who replied something about individual choices to do whatever she wanted. Off asked her about a common phrase, that \"my freedom ends where your freedom begins\" and the convoy member had no idea what to do with that. She couldn't understand the concept. Off goes on throughout the book about this fundamental clash through history and the present between those who see the goal as their freedom to hurt and rule over whoever they want, and those who see the goal as an equitable freedom inclusive of everyone.\n\nThat's a lack of empathetic imagination, a total inability to comprehend that other humans exist and your actions will impact them.\n\nThe peak time of COVID may have been an ultimate example of this. There was a brief window where it seemed like everyone was on the same page that we need to look after each other because a virus is fundamentally a social problem, especially one that spreads at a rate faster than one new infection per current infection as COVID does (much less so when a significant portion of the population is vaccinated). Then the backlash began, where a significant portion of the population made it clear that they were tired of caring about other people. They talked openly about sacrificing the elderly, disabled, and children for the sake of their \"freedom\" to go to a crowded bar or whatever else they wanted to do.\n\nJust what is the right political approach to \"freedoms\" can be complicated. We don't want a government enforcing tyranny on individuals. But we do want a government that can help remind individuals that we aren't just individuals - that whether we like it or not, we are in this world and this political entity together. And most importantly, we want a government that is able to understand that one group exercising its freedom may be a taking away of freedom from others. It is never as simple as \"freedom\" for everyone vs \"tyranny\" for everyone. But I do think a fundamental requirement for a functional society is some empathetic imagination, letting us wrestle with some of those complicated moments while maintaining understanding of what it will mean to others, particularly those most marginalized. That fundamental requirement is currently lacking.\n\n## Accessible Web Dev\n\nOne more tangent is to tie this idea into my day job, building websites.\n\nMy previous job was for a small company where I was primarily building small websites and CRM systems for non-profits. It's important work, I'm glad somebody is doing it, and I still recommend the people there when I encounter someone that could use those services. But there is something inherent to that style of work, constantly bouncing between doing similar jobs for multiple clients as fast as possible in order to not lose money, that gets tiring. A chunk of that may be that there is no time to get deep on technical challenges, but even more I realized after starting my current job: there isn't any time for empathetic imagination. It's all about getting through the checklist as fast as possible. That includes when it comes to accessibility, which usually had a bare minimum checklist to clear with some automated tools.\n\nOne of the first big non-technical things I learned in my current job was working with a blind student consultant, who was able to walk some of us sighted staff through her experiences. Instead of \"does this test fail\" my question became a lot more of \"how does her experience compare to a sighted experience? Is there more we can do to make that equal?\" That's a radically different way of thinking.\n\nBlind users may be the biggest focus of website accessibility; since websites are primarily visible, that's the group most consistently left out if the site is not built well. But that's not the only group to consider. What if you're deaf and encounter a video with sound? What if you're colour-blind, or have low vision? What if you're brand new to the subject of the site with no knowledge of the jargon, vs those who know exactly what they're looking for?\n\nI write about some of those more on my tech blog and won't repeat it all here, but I did want to tie it into the idea of empathetic imagination. I am routinely needing to imagine the experiences of others. It makes me a better developer, and I think it makes me a better person.\n","date":"2025-01-02T21:46:00.000Z"},"/2025/theological-background/":{"id":"/2025/theological-background/","title":"Church and Theological Background","description":"My theological and church background includes United, Anabaptist, liberationist, and liturgical.","tags":"posts Church","content":"\nI've been invited to join a group spanning a few churches (a Unitarian, a United, and my Mennonite) to share reactions to the lectionary text for the week. We were asked to give a bit of an introduction of our backgrounds first, which is also appropriate to share here as I slowly rebuild some online theological presence.\n\n## Introduction\n\nI grew up in a small rural United Church (that's United Church of Canada, but if you're reading this in the US, your United Church of Christ is a fairly close parallel). I tend to describe it as \"moderate evangelical.\" It was absolutely adamant that the Gospel was penal substitution: that God's justice demanded violent penalty for sin, so God came as Jesus to be the sacrifice taking on that penalty so we didn't have to. I solidly reject that now for a lot of reasons. But it was not particularly strict on much else that is now common associated with the word \"evangelical\": we had women in leadership, we didn't affirm same-sex relationships but we were part of a denomination that did and we didn't see any need to fight over it, and we generally tried to care about people.\n\nWhen I left for university, I first went to a Canadian Baptist church, which was mostly in a similar category: strict on penal substitution but would be labelled as \"liberal\" in today's climate on some other fronts, like a very strong refugee support ministry.\n\nA lot of that time I was adjacent to a lot of more extreme conservative Christianity, from views on gender to sexuality to the Bible and the rest, especially in the early days of the Internet when I started encountering more resources on what being a Christian meant and most of those resources were coming from more extreme perspectives. Some of it I bought into a bit more than others, but it never quite felt right.\n\nAfter undergrad, I did a seminary degree at Queen's School of Religion, which was officially tied to the United Church but had a lot of instructors from a variety of denominations. During that time I somewhat drifted between checking out a few different churches: most often was a United that was liberal in pretty much any definition but there was also a Free Methodist I really enjoyed going to and several others I checked out. It's also when I started to appreciate a lot more of the liturgical side of the tradition.\n\nAll through both of those degrees I had found The Meeting House, which some of you may have heard of either for good reasons in the past or less good reasons more recently. This was my introduction to the Anabaptist tradition and I found myself more and more feeling like that was the best descriptor for how I understood Jesus.\n\nI got married right after university and we went to The Meeting House when we moved to Toronto. Then we went to The Meeting House when we moved to Hamilton. Then we went to The Meeting House when we moved to Kitchener. Then for a few reasons we decided it was time to try something else, and quickly settled at [Rockway Mennonite](https://rockwaymc.ca) where we have been since.\n\nAlong with the Anabaptist influence, I look heavily toward liberation theologies. I would not normally call myself liberal, at least not without checking what the other person means by it first, since it can mean a lot of things and some of those things apply more than others. I would normally use liberationist instead. Liberal has too much connotation to me of educated white people sitting around and talking about things abstractly without interacting with those who are more oppressed or doing much about that oppression directly, while liberationist is driven by the oppressed.\n\nSo that's largely my theological perspective: liberationist Anabaptist with some bits that sound a little evangelical and some liturgical impulses still in there.\n","date":"2025-01-25T10:30:00.000Z"},"/2025/lectionary-jan26/":{"id":"/2025/lectionary-jan26/","title":"Lectionary Notes: Jan 26, 2025","description":"This week includes themes of communal reflection and unity.","tags":"posts","content":"\nI've been invited to join a group spanning a few churches (a Unitarian, a United, and my Mennonite) to share reactions to the lectionary text for the week. Here are my notes going into the first week, January 26, 2025, the third Sunday after Epiphany.\n\n## The Texts\n\n[Here are the texts](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=384&z=e&d=15).\n\n## Nehemiah 8:1-3, 5-6, 8-10\n\nThe Law needed interpretation. It is not something that is immediately obvious. It takes some community coming together to interpret it together and figure out what it means in a new context. That's an appropriate idea for this first week coming together with this new group.\n\nAnd this communal interpretation of the Law was perhaps especially necessary as they started to rebuild their society after Exile. They didn't have a lot of momentum of tradition to fall back on. That's interesting to think about as our culture has less of a default shared understanding of many of the biblical stories or other aspects of tradition. We had a Christian History university prof at our church recently, and one of the things he said is that he can no longer assume students know even general ideas like \"who was Jesus\".\n\n## Psalm 19\n\nThe Law is good and beneficial, bringing joy and wisdom. This reminds me of the 1 Timothy 3:16 text. That comes up fairly often in evangelical circles, but I think they're largely missing the point. The author there concludes that Scripture is useful. Before we can get into any big theological labels like inerrancy or infallibility, sometimes we need the simpler starting point: it is useful, it has value. It's not the only thing that has value. The psalm notably starts with how nature itself also proclaims God. But it does have value.\n\n\"Hidden faults\" also jumped out at me. Sometimes we can't see how we are hurting ourselves or others, and we need some outside source to help us see. Maybe that's Scripture, or another source of written wisdom. Maybe that's the church, or some other person. Maybe it's a nudging of the Holy Spirit in prayer.\n\n## 1 Corinthians 12:12-31a\n\nThis is certainly another appropriate text for the first week doing a group with multiple churches, as it reminds us of the need for many parts of the body.\n\nOne question: how much does this mean that each local community needs a lot of diversity within itself, vs those communities needing to keep connected to other communities and those connections needing to be diverse?\n\nThe big question, though: where is the balance for those who claim to be part of the Christian tradition but are explicitly rejecting any teaching of Jesus? I'm thinking of white nationalists who will say they are acting for Christianity and then directly say that Jesus was wrong or too woke or whatever other buzzword they're using now to dismiss it. I'm not talking about people who try and fail sometimes, but those who are actively opposed while still claiming the label as a weapon against others. [I had a couple sermons on that recently](https://theology.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/cult-innocence/), so I'm not going to go too deep down that rabbit hole again, but I think it's the single most defining tension for the church at this moment.\n\nAnother question that you need to be able to ask more within your own specific communities: if one member suffers, we all suffer? Really? How often do we feel like that in our churches, in our very individualistic society? It can be easy for one member to suffer in silence while everyone else goes on their way.\n\n## Luke 4:14-21\n\nThat big question from Corinthians leads into the Luke text. Jesus chose to start his public ministry by declaring liberation to captives, recovery of sight to the blind, freedom for the oppressed, and declaring a Jubilee year which is when all debts are wiped out and economic equality is restored. He notably stops the Isaiah reading, from chapter 61, right before it promises \"the day of vengeance of our God,\" which might be why in the next part of the story people got mad at him and tried to kill him. As people under the boot of the Roman Empire, they were probably pretty happy with the liberation parts, but then Jesus stops before promising vengeance on those Romans. Maybe more on that next week.\n","date":"2025-01-25T11:00:00.000Z"},"/2025/lectionary-feb-2/":{"id":"/2025/lectionary-feb-2/","title":"Lectionary Notes: Feb 2, 2025","description":"This week includes themes of prophecy, love, and in-group/out-group dynamics.","tags":"posts","content":"\nI've joined a group spanning a few churches (a United, my Mennonite, and another Mennonite - a Unitarian was also invited but they all withdrew late) to share reactions to the lectionary text for the week. Here are my notes going into the second week, February 2, 2025, the fourth Sunday after Epiphany.\n\n## The Texts\n\n[Here are the texts](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=384&z=e&d=16).\n\n## Jeremiah 1:4-10\n\nThe calling of Jeremiah follows a fairly standard formula for prophetic calls in Scripture. He says he isn't worthy and God says \"too bad, I've empowered you to do it anyway.\" This is true of basically all the prophets, except Jonah who is arrogant and thinks he knows better than God, which is part of why Jonah is probably best understood as a satire.\n\nWhat has God empowered Jeremiah to do? To be \"over nations and kingdoms, to pluck up and to pull down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.\" That's an interesting mix of building something new/better as well as destroying things that are bad. It's maybe especially interesting Jeremiah is generally the most depressing prophet, with the most focus on how bad things are and less silver linings of hope than most.\n\n## Psalm 71:1-6\n\nThe psalm picks up on similar themes of leaning on God's strength when you don't have your own.\n\nIt also picks up on some of the language of being chosen from birth, if not before it. Some of that \"before birth\" language does make me a little nervous sometimes since it gets used for anti-abortion rhetoric, but that rhetoric is definitely a stretch of the text to make it fit a certain predetermined argument, so I don't want to get too hung up on it.\n\n## 1 Corinthians 13:1-13\n\nThis is a well-known text, with the love portion often read at weddings. There's a lot of value in that on its own, emphasizing how love is the way that we treat each other well. Love is not the boastful or arrogant dictation of what is best for others, but the patient and kind connecting with the beloved in order to seek their true wellbeing as equals.\n\nBut what's really interesting when paired with the other texts is the \"if I have prophetic powers... but do not have love, I am nothing.\" The Jeremiah text sounds like prophecy is pretty great and important. And it is. But it isn't an end goal in itself. If there isn't love connected to that, it means nothing that Jeremiah was chosen to do those great things.\n\n## Luke 4:21-30\n\nThis is the second half of last week's story, where it really picks up. Last week's was relatively easy to think it was a nice friendly declaration of liberation, but in the second half, we see the story turn.\n\nJesus has started quoting from Isaiah 61, but then stops before the part promising God's vengeance, which in their context would have been primarily seen as against the Romans. He declares that the promises of liberation have been fulfilled right then, without mentioning the vengeance.\n\nThe listeners were then amazed at the \"gracious words\", which I can only interpret as surprising grace toward the Romans by leaving that part out since the parts he did say were simply quoting Isaiah. Then they wonder if this is really their local Jesus, the son of Joseph. This is the part where it hit me differently than it ever had before. Normally I hear this preached as them being surprised that this guy they knew could grow up to be such a powerful teacher and healer (they'd already heard what he'd done in Capernaum). That's a fairly innocent reaction of pride for their local boy all grown up now. But another way to read this, in light of Jesus skipping the part about Roman vengeance, might be more like: \"this guy grew up here, poor and oppressed under Roman authority like the rest of us, and he dares to declare this Scripture fulfilled while the Romans are still ruling over us? We're still waiting for that freedom and for that vengeance!\"\n\nJesus makes what might sound like a topic change, saying no prophet is accepted in his hometown, then tells the story of how Elijah and Elisha went to help foreigners at a time when a lot of Israelites could have really used that help. That's when they get so enraged they are ready to throw him off a cliff before stopping for an unspoken reason as he passes through them (perhaps because this being a Sabbath, they were not willing to travel farther than the Law allowed).\n\nSo... maybe the reason why the prophet is never accepted in their hometown is because the hometown demands that the prophet give them special favour, declare that they are more important and more loved by God than anyone else, declaring that they will win and exact their revenge on their enemies soon? But like Jeremiah, who largely prophesied that Babylon was coming to conquer them, Jesus didn't do that.\n\nA key takeaway for me: real prophetic work is often likely to invoke a lot of anger, especially if those being prophesied to feel betrayed by a prophet who was supposed to be on \"their side,\" because real prophetic work includes dismantling some of that framework of \"sides.\" It's not dismissing the evils of Roman oppression or any other oppressive systems, but it is also rejecting simple violent revenge as the solution to it.\n","date":"2025-02-01T11:00:00.000Z"},"/2025/lectionary-feb9/":{"id":"/2025/lectionary-feb9/","title":"Lectionary Notes: Feb 9, 2025","description":"This week includes themes of feelings of unworthiness and God calling us anyway.","tags":"posts","content":"\nI've joined a group spanning a few churches to share reactions to the lectionary text for the week. Here are my notes going into February 9, 2025, the fifth Sunday after Epiphany.\n\n## The Texts\n\n[Here are the texts](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?z=e&d=18&y=384).\n\n## Isaiah 6:1-13\n\nFor the second week in a row, we get a prophetic call story. This time it is Isaiah and it is more poetic, but the key points are the same: God is holy, the prophet is unworthy, God offers some kind of healing or purification that convinces the prophet to proclaim coming destruction. Even though Isaiah, unlike Jeremiah, is mostly seen as a very hopeful text, that isn't as obvious in this call narrative.\n\n## Psalm 138\n\nThis is also similar to last week's Psalm in some of its themes: God is mighty but has special care for those judged to be lowly in human culture, protecting them from their enemies.\n\n## 1 Corinthians 15:1-11\n\n\"Christ died for our sins\" definitely has some potential to go down the atonement theory rabbit. Those who believe in penal substitutionary atonement may see this as a prooftext, but it doesn't actually anything about God's wrath or justice needing to be satisfied. Even the \"for our sins\" may be a questionable preposition translation, if I am remembering correctly. I don't have a good source for that handy, but I believe that is just as easily translated to \"because of our sins\" which is a simpler cause and effect, not necessarily implying that our sins were placed on Jesus as a scapegoat in order to absorb our penalty.\n\nThe other prooftext rabbit hole it is easy to go down here is apologetics. It cites more than five hundred who witnessed the risen Jesus. That's not really an airtight apologetics argument since it's not like we have any way of verifying that those five hundred people really did encounter the risen Jesus and told everyone about it. But that's not really a focus in this text either.\n\nMore to the point of this text is in line with the prophetic call narratives of these past two weeks and the psalms of the past two weeks. Paul is emphasizing that he is not that significant, the last to see the risen Christ, the least of the apostles, unfit to be called an apostle, etc. But because of God's grace toward those who are not worthy, he now is preaching that grace to others.\n\n## Luke 5:1-11\n\nThis is one of those Jesus stories that seem a little silly at first. They've been fishing all night, not catching much, and Jesus comes along and tells them to put their nets a few feet away on the other side of the boat. Seriously, why would moving the net that small distance go from catching nothing to being completely full immediately, enough that the boat starts to sink. And that's how Simon (Peter), James and John were recruited to become disciples.\n\nIt carries some of the themes from the other texts: they aren't particularly worthy. They can't even catch fish on their own, which is their whole job. Simon Peter declares that he is too sinful to be worthy of joining Jesus. Jesus reassures them to not be afraid and to join him despite their \"unworthiness.\" Then they left everything - all those fish that they had just worked all day trying to catch - in order to take Jesus up on his offer.\n","date":"2025-02-08T11:00:00.000Z"},"/2025/lectionary-feb16/":{"id":"/2025/lectionary-feb16/","title":"Lectionary Notes: Feb 16, 2025","description":"This week includes themes of trust, wealth, and judgement.","tags":"posts","content":"\nI've joined a group spanning a few churches to share reactions to the lectionary text for the week. Here are my notes going into February 16, 2025, the sixth Sunday after Epiphany.\n\n## The Texts\n\n[Here are the texts](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=384&z=e&d=19).\n\nI'm not going to do each text separately as I have the past few weeks, because there isn't a lot unique between them jumping out at me. There are a couple major themes, though.\n\n## Trust and Wealth\n\nA theme in all four texts is to trust in God, not in the ways of the wicked. The Luke text at least partially equates \"the wicked\" with \"the rich.\"\n\nThey each tackle that we have some drive, maybe naturally and/or maybe fueled by the advice of those wicked systems and individuals, trying to convince us that we will be satisfied if we pursue wealth for ourselves. We just need to climb to the top of the social hierarchy and then everything will be fine. Not for the people we have to climb over, of course, but let's not think about them - let's focus on me.\n\nBut Jeremiah says that this leads to being like a shrub in the desert, not seeing relief, unlike those who trust in the LORD who will continue to bear fruit and not be anxious. Psalm 1 emphasizes that the wicked will be driven away by the wind, while again those who delight in God will yield fruit and not wither. Those are very similar metaphors.\n\n1 Corinthians starts to tie this into the resurrection. If that hope of trusting in God is only in life, it is futile. It is obvious that if we are judging only by short-term material wealth and social power, the way of Jesus is pretty naive and ineffective. But if we believe that there is a longer arc of history than that, that there is resurrection, the hope is valid.\n\nLuke most explicitly ties this into wealth, sending woe on the rich and blessings on the poor. Matthew's version of this in the Sermon on the Mount is a bit more abstracted, about the \"poor in spirit\" without the accompanying woe on the rich, but Luke is more direct to the point. If you prioritize wealth and people speaking well of you, you might get it in the short term, but that's the entire reward. It's an Ebenezer Scrooge situation, where you get your wealth for now but you are miserable and have no meaning beyond that. \"You have received your consolation.\"\n\n## Hope for Justice\n\nAnother related theme that is present here is that 3 out of the 4 texts (not really the Corinthians one) clearly displays some desire to see negative consequences for those who are doing evil. This is often not a popular position among more privileged \"liberal\" communities who often want to get rid of any language like that entirely, since it sounds too close to the vindictive god held by more conservative communities who are also often privileged in other ways.\n\nBut I don't think justice and vindictive punishment need to be the same thing. When you have been truly mistreated, especially on a systemic level, it is absolutely normal and in my opinion correct to wish to see consequences - the \"woe\" that Jesus promises - on those who are hurting you. That doesn't need to be violent gleeful punishment, but we should be able to acknowledge that something is wrong with this picture and something needs to be done to change it.\n\nTo bring in the Corinthians a bit less directly, what if God's justice looks like the death and resurrection of Jesus. It was not justice that killed Jesus. It was profoundly unjust, with those in power deciding to shut down somebody who challenged their power, even though he had not done anything provably illegal to justify a death penalty even by the laws of the time. And yet, if we believe Jesus was the incarnate God who chose that willingly and then was brought back to life? That changes how we think about justice. It isn't about hurting for the sake of hurting the Romans who killed Jesus, but it does expose and overcome the injustice they committed. God's power is greater than that injustice and greater than death, which is often the implicit or explicit threat of those carrying out the injustice. If those acting unjustly no longer have the power of death to threaten you, they have no real power over you at all. Real justice requires exposing their injustice. At best, maybe they learn from the consequences of their injustice being exposed and they repent (turn around to a more just way of being).\n\nIt's the difference between retributive justice, seeking to punish for the sake of punishing, and restorative justice, seeking to make the world whole again (including the oppressors if they will accept it). Being critical of retributive justice is great, but don't replace that with \"well I guess there is no justice.\" Instead, try to imagine a restored world, where the oppression is stopped and hopefully the oppressor learns after experiencing those negative consequences to not try it again.\n","date":"2025-02-15T11:00:00.000Z"},"/2025/kingdom-planet-apes/":{"id":"/2025/kingdom-planet-apes/","title":"Religious Legacy in Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes","description":"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes has a few great things to say about religious legacy and kingdom-building.","tags":"posts Movies and TV Church","content":"\nOne of my favourite movies of 2024 was _Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes_, despite it getting mostly just ok reviews. I watched it again recently after picking up the 4K Blu-ray. I love how it handles legacy and the conflict between maintaining a message of peace and those who want to use that brand while furthering the opposite of peace, violent empire building.\n\n## Encountering a Compassionate Caesar\n\nFor some background, in the previous 3 movies, Caesar was the leader of the apes. He wasn't perfect, but mostly he managed to unite apes to work together and to not start any fights with humans. Over the course of that trilogy, the power dynamic flipped from humans being dominant and apes just trying to survive to a more equal war and eventually to humans fighting for their survival, but Caesar remained true to his convictions of trying to find a peaceful coexistence.\n\n_Kingdom_ jumps ahead several generations. Our new main character Noa hasn't even heard of Caesar at first, coming of age happily in his peaceful ape community living harmoniously in nature. But then his community is attacked and taken away and he must set out to save them. During the attack is the first and second time we hear \"For Caesar\" as a clear battle cry of the attacking apes. They clearly see what they are doing as part of the legacy of Caesar.\n\nHe then meets Raka, who is very much styled after a priest, with a stole and a pendant with a religious-like symbol on it. Raka explains that his work has been to protect the real legacy of Caesar. He declares that the attackers are shameful to misuse Caesar's name and how it is sad that so few remember the true Caesar, with him as the last member of the Order of Caesar. He repeats \"Apes together strong\" and \"ape shall not kill ape,\" a couple of Caesar's main recurring phrases. He explains that humans are slow witted but there was a time when humans and apes lived side by side, during the time of Caesar, and they were important to Caesar, so he will do his best to be compassionate to them as well.\n\nThey see a human (played by Freya Allen) near Noa's horse and Noa tries to scare her away, but Raka says that she is not a threat. Raka then decides to join Noa on his journey because the human is following Noa, which intrigues Raka. Raka is kind to the human, sharing food and warmth while encouraging mercy. He names her Nova, the name for all humans, although he doesn't know why, just that it has been that way since Caesar's time (that happened in the previous movie, _War_). He explains how Caesar cared so much for humans, leading with decency, morality, compassion. Noa is skeptical but plays along, then starts to realize that she is smart and develops some compassion for her because she reacts to looking through a telescope the same way he does. They decide to share a horse so she can come with them.\n\nThey encounter a \"herd\" of other humans, who don't have the intelligence of Nova, but they are then attacked by the same mysterious group who attacked Noa's community earlier. Noa saves Nova, but in the process Nova reveals that she can speak.\n\nA few scenes of bonding later, Raka sacrifices himself to save Nova whose real name we have now learned is Mae, and as he is about to die he says \"together strong.\" Not \"ape together strong,\" just \"together strong.\" He is modifying Caesars words but to maintain Caesars teaching about compassion for humans. That is a fascinating insight into healthy religion: cling to the love message that matters and be a little loose with specific phrases. Some branches of religious traditions get that backwards.\n\n## Proximus and Empire\n\nNoa and Mae are captured by the violent group of apes and we start to see how their interpretation of Caesar is extremely different. They are assembling an Empire. Proximus, their leader, gets a lot of his inspiration learning about Ancient Roman history. They interpret \"apes together strong\" in a much more fascist way: that they must force all apes to work together over and against humans. It's not about strength in diverse unity. It's about strength through dominant uniformity with one clear ape in charge.\n\nThis part also has [some major Tower of Babel vibes](/posts/2021/many-tongues/). Apes from all kinds of diverse communities are forced to work together against their will to further the power of their new Caesar, Proximus, just as the slaves building Babel were forced to work for that empire.\n\nThe way this oppressive oppressive kingdom is ultimately broken down is also like the Babel story: they embrace their diverse roots; they do not accept that they are only ape slaves to Proximus.\n\nProximus talks about the need for evolution, to become even stronger, more dominant over others. He refers to \"my kingdom\" which is the kind of sense of ownership over other apes that Caesar never showed. The contrast couldn't get much stronger.\n\n## The Christian Allegory\n\nThis all seemed like a pretty obvious allegory of Christianity, or for that matter, pretty much any religion or tradition that has ever had the opportunity to hold power over others. There will be some who declare that their religion requires them to dominate others, to enforce uniformity, to put themselves in charge for the good of everyone. Even if all of that explicitly goes against the teachings of their founder.\n\nBut there are also those like Raka, those who are determined to maintain the peaceful vision of their founder, who encourage compassion toward those who are different and celebrates diversity.\n\nWe have a choice which mode of maintaining our tradition we advance.\n","date":"2025-02-19T16:46:00.000Z"},"/2025/lectionary-feb23/":{"id":"/2025/lectionary-feb23/","title":"Lectionary Notes: Feb 23, 2025","description":"This week explores power reversals, with or without retribution.","tags":"posts","content":"\nI've joined a group spanning a few churches to share reactions to the lectionary text for the week. Here are my notes going into February 23, 2025, the seventh Sunday after Epiphany.\n\n## The Texts\n\n[Here are the texts](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=384&z=e&d=20).\n\n## Genesis 45:3-11, 15\n\nThis picks up at the (mostly) happy ending of the story. At this point, Joseph reveals himself to his brothers, says something that sounds like forgiveness of what they did to him selling him as a slave into Egypt, and declares how even though they meant harm God worked it out for the good of everyone. He promises to provide for them during the famine and kisses them and wept. That's a pretty powerful story of reunion, reconciliation, and God working even through evil to bring about a good outcome.\n\nBut if you read the few chapters before this, starting at chapter 42, Joseph did a lot of torturing his brothers before this big moment of forgiveness. Most of the brothers, all but Benjamin, first come to Egypt to buy food because there's a famine and only Egypt stockpiled enough food (thanks to Joseph's interpretation of dreams). They meet Joseph but don't recognize him, having assumed he died a long time ago or at least was still a slave. He recognizes them, accuses them of being spies, and says that the rest of them will stay in prison until one of them goes back and gets Benjamin, which somehow will prove that they're not spies. He put them all in prison for 3 days, then softens the offer to only making Simeon stay. Then he puts the silver which the brothers had used to buy the food back into their sacks so that they will panic when they see it, knowing that they will be accused of theft.\n\nThe brothers (other than Simeon) get back to Jacob and tell them they need to take Benjamin this time. They get back to Egypt with everything they have to offer, including a lot more silver, and immediately explain how they got their silver back on the previous trip. Joseph says that's fine, serves them a giant dinner, and then does the same thing again: sends them on their way but with their silver returned quietly to their bags. That sounds generous. But this time instead of letting them go, he immediately sends somebody to catch them, accuse them of theft, and threaten to make whoever is found to have the silver a slave. That is Benjamin, Jacob's favourite. Judah knows that this would kill his father Jacob to lose Benjamin and offers to stay instead.\n\nThat's when we get to this passage and its happy ending. With the time to travel back and forth between Egypt and Canaan, this would have been months of emotional torture of his brothers and father, and keeping one in prison. There is no apology for any of that.\n\nOf course, the big theme here that lines up with other recent weeks and other texts this week: God reverses our power structures. The older brothers meant to harm him, but God took care of him and ultimately put him in a position of power over his brothers where they depended on him. That part is powerful and reassuring in a world where we often feel like we don't see justice. But in this particular story, there is a lot of cruelty along the way, and on its own it might be too easy to fall into concepts of justice that require extensive punishment before forgiveness is possible.\n\n## Psalm 37:1-11, 39-40\n\nIt largely has the same themes of the reversal of power, but explicitly without a lot of the retribution first. This is clear that you should not fret because of the wicket, refrain from anger, forsake wrath. In short, we don't need to seek retribution because God will make sure things are set right. God is our salvation and refuge, not needing to take revenge into our own hands.\n\n## 1 Corinthians 15:35-38, 42,50\n\nThis flows fairly well out of the above theme of the psalm. We trust that God will make things right, not following the logic of the world that demands we take vengeance ourselves. This is supported by the resurrection, where God in Jesus allowed himself to be killed but then came back. This shows that God has power over death and those who seek to wield death. The power reversal happens, but it comes through death which at first seems like it is supporting the existing power. \"What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.\"\n\n## Luke 6:27-38\n\nThe Luke text perhaps makes these themes a bit more practical. While the psalm and Corinthians declare that God will bring salvation from the wicked powers of the world, Luke gets more down-to-earth in what this looks like when you are oppressed by those wicked powers. Rather than only loving those who love you, Jesus commands that we are to also love our enemies, which in that context would have included some brutal Roman oppressors.\n\nFirst, there is an interesting three steps of hatred toward you:\n\n1. Do good to those who hate you.\n2. Bless those who curse you.\n3. Pray for those who mistreat you.\n\nAt first, if somebody hates you but isn't directly harming you, you have some potential to actively do good to them, which will maybe cutting them off from hating you. If it escalates to them actively cursing you, you can actively bless them in return. If they are actively harming you, you probably aren't in a position anymore to actively seek practical good for them, but you can still pray for them.\n\nThe \"turn the other cheek\" part is often misinterpreted as encouraging passivity, however. This isn't accurate. The Matthew version of this text, in 5:38-40, is a bit more clear, as it specifies that if someone slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek as well. What's the difference? Try to imagine if somebody is looking at you and they're right-handed as everyone was assumed to be. For them to slap you on your right cheek, they need to backhand you. This part is still mostly true today: a backhand slap is usually a sign of dominating power over someone who think is clearly inferior to you. You don't backhand someone who is your equal. So when you turn the other cheek, you're essentially saying \"you may have the power to slap me but I'm going to make you look me in the eye and treat me as an equal while you do it.\" And that sounds a lot like nonviolent resistance movements in the modern world.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere is an interesting progression in the order of these texts, which doesn't always work out that way.\n\n1. In Genesis, we see God working for the good despite evil situations, reversing power structures to put the little brother sold into slavery back in a position over his brothers. But he still clearly felt he had to do some major revenge first.\n2. The Psalm encourages us to let go of our anger and trust that God will take care of that power reversal without us needing to take revenge.\n3. In Corinthians, we see how that parallels the logic of death and resurrection, requiring that we die to self in order to be raised again in God's new life.\n4. In Luke, Jesus explicitly teaches us to do some of that dying to self by loving those enemies even while they are oppressing us.\n","date":"2025-02-23T13:00:00.000Z"},"/2025/lectionary-mar2/":{"id":"/2025/lectionary-mar2/","title":"Lectionary Notes: Mar 2, 2025","description":"This week for the Transfiguration includes talk of mountains, shining faces, veils, and religious continuity.","tags":"posts","content":"\nI've been invited to join a group spanning a few churches to share reactions to the lectionary text for the week. Here are my notes going into our final week, Transfiguration Sunday.\n\n## The Texts\n\n[Here are the texts](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=384&z=e&d=23).\n\nThis one felt more like the same themes throughout all of them, rather than a progression from one text to the next, so I'm going to structure my notes that way.\n\n## Mountains\n\nInteresting that the encounters with God happen on a mountain each time. It wasn't unusual in the ancient world to see mountains as liminal spaces, where the gods could more easily meet with humans. Mountains also had practical advantages as the best places to build a city: easier to defend from attackers, easier to have waste water flow downhill away from drinking supplies.\n\nMaybe we could argue there's still some sense that \"mountains as liminal space\" is true because being on a mountain evokes awe at creation which can make you feel closer to God, but I'm not going to read too much more into it than that.\n\n## Shining\n\nI love the idea of faces literally shining after encountering God. Jesus is shining in the Transfiguration. Moses shines without even realizing it after talking with God and receiving the commands. Corinthians doesn't reference shining but does promise transformation in other ways: real freedom, not losing heart, sticking to the truth and conscience.\n\n## Veils\n\nIn fact, Moses' face shone so much that he had to put a veil over his face. He had to be an intermediary between the Israelites and God because the glory of God was scary to the Israelites.\n\nCorinthians uses the veil language a slightly different way. After referencing how Moses needed a veil to keep people from looking directly at God's glory, he claims that whenever Moses is read, there is still a veil over their minds. In contrast, when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed and now we see the glory of the Lord as if through a mirror, a perfect reflection. By seeing that perfect image of God, we also become more transformed into that image.\n\nThe veiled message through Moses wasn't wrong. But it was a little bit blurry, veiled for a people who weren't quite ready for it. Now in Jesus we can see more clearly.\n\nThere is some potential for antisemitism in the veil idea, if we equate \"in Jesus we think we see God more clearly\" as \"Jewish people are inferior.\" There isn't a logical reason why the former would lead to the latter, but it is pretty common in our culture to take a lot of our sense of worth from being right about something, especially the big worldview-shaping things like religious belief. We can simply and humbly acknowledge that the Christian tradition thinks Jesus is the clear revelation of God. It's fine that Jews and Muslims and Hindus and Buddhists and everyone else disagrees. That doesn't make us superior to them. There's no reason why difference has to mean hierarchy.\n\n## Continuity\n\nI think the essential counter in these texts to some of the antisemitism risk is that Jesus is within a long line of Jews who encountered God. We get the Moses story, shining so brightly that others couldn't look at him. The psalm references Moses, Aaron, and Samuel. Corinthians mentions Moses. And Luke mentions Moses and Elijah. There is a sense that Jesus is the fullest revelation of God, but that is firmly coming within the continuity of the Jewish tradition, not discarding that tradition at all.\n","date":"2025-03-01T11:00:00.000Z"},"/2025/whose-armour/":{"id":"/2025/whose-armour/","title":"Whose Armour?","description":"A sermon about hope for the fight based on the God's Armour passage of Ephesians.","tags":"posts Sermon Bible","content":"\n## Scripture Text\n\n[Ephesians 6:10-24 (CEB)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians%206%3A10-24&version=CEB)\n\n## Video\n\n\n\n## Transcript\n\nWe've reached the end of this series on Ephesians. We've covered some big topics like salvation, diversity in unity, new creation, and a liberatory reading of the household code that invited us into an empowered mutual servanthood. Somehow, despite some of those themes of diversity and liberation, the team we managed to assemble for this series were five white men.\n\n### The Call to Fight\n\nThat does put us in positions of relative privilege, as the ones who benefit in the short-term from unjust systems. A very privileged interpretation of this text might be one that is about dominating through force or coercion, that this is about how we need to fight to establish ourselves and protect our people against those other people. It's about being tough.\n\nOr at the very least, maybe it's \"spiritual warfare\" which for me mostly makes me think of an episode in _Xena Warrior Princess_. Xena and Gabrielle are recruited into a battle between angels and demons and there's lots of flying around and sword fighting and it was really cool to teenage Ryan.\n\nThere is still a strong contingent of the Christian tradition that would say things like that, even though it is hard to reconcile with Jesus. It is also hard to reconcile with this text, which quickly establishes that our battle is not against human enemies. That idea falls apart even faster within the context of the rest of the letter spending so much time talking about things like reconciliation between groups that don't get along. It's clearly not about one group needing to dominate the other. Let's quickly discard that framework, because it doesn't really deserve any more attention than that. [See a couple of sermons in the Fall](https://theology.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/cult-innocence/) if you do want to engage more with that topic.\n\n### Principalities and Powers\n\nBut this text does support the idea that we do need to be ready to fight in some sense. We don't have a battle against human enemies, but we do against what many translations put something like \"principalities and powers.\" My apologies to the tech team for all the plosive p's in repeating this phrase. With maybe some exceptions for the charismatic tradition, \"principalities and powers\" is not language that we normally use.\n\nThe Common English Bible translation instead unpacks that into \"rulers, authorities, forces of cosmic darkness, and spiritual powers of evil in the heavens.\" That's doing something interesting, because it essentially includes the two possible ways to understand who the enemies are in this battle. Rulers and authorities suggest earthly human power structures, the ways that we dominate each other. Forces of cosmic darkness and spiritual powers of evil in the heavens suggest something more supernatural. We might use a word like demons. Or it at least suggests something more abstract about our way of living in the world.\n\nEphesians does not say a lot directly about the nature of these powers and principalities. It's not generally something that was high priority for the original Paul or any of these other authors who wrote later in his name.\n\nBut they do come up at a higher rate in Ephesians than anywhere else in Paul. According to Clinton Arnold in Ephesians: Power and Magic, Ephesus was seen to be a major centre for magical practice. By \"magic\" we mean something like: learning the correct speech and actions that allow you to control spiritual forces that would otherwise harm you.\n\nIn addition to other ancient sources, this claim by Arnold is supported by Acts 19, which describes Paul's time in Ephesus. That includes encounters with several people who practiced this kind of magic and then repented by burning all their very valuable magical texts. Acts attributes more demons to Ephesus than anywhere else in Paul's journeys.\n\nThat may be why Paul talks about these powers and principalities more in Ephesians than anywhere else. As is always true with reading these letters, they have a context with specific things the audience was thinking about and that the author was trying to address.\n\nSo that's one half of what we saw in the CEB translation, the demon half. And there is a good argument that this is all that Paul meant here.\n\nMost modern interpreters don't like reducing it to only be about that, though, for a few reasons:\n\n1. There's the modernist bias, that we often start with a presupposition that there is no evidence to believe that such demons exist. If the text is only about those, and we dismiss those, it doesn't leave us with anything else that it says.\n2. There's the practical pastoral concern that it can create a scenario of being so focused on these spiritual forces battling out there, it's easy to ignore what's happening right in front of you.\n3. The one that is most compelling to me: there are plenty of other biblical texts and extra-biblical texts from the same time and even a couple centuries earlier that suggest these two ideas can go together, not be contradictory. These often align the imagery of these spiritual forces with systemic injustices or more broadly the battle between good ways of being in relationship and bad ways of being in relationship. Even within this text, it goes on to explain that the weapons and armour for defeating these evil forces are things like truth, peace, salvation, justice, and the word of God. If it were strictly talking about evil demons, you might expect more \"magical\" tools like prayer, fasting, maybe some charismatic gifts which Paul isn't afraid to talk about elsewhere. Also, this text references back to Isaiah which was within a context of being conquered by a literal foreign empire and seeking liberation from that.\n\nSo, there is good reason to believe that it is at least talking about this more abstracted battle between good and bad ways of being, the way of God and the way of the oppressive Empire. Perhaps that's in addition to literal spiritual forces, but I have a hard time believing that it only meant literal spiritual forces.\n\nEither way, there are a couple more important points here.\n\nFirst, evil does exist. It's true that we can't neatly divide between the good people and the evil people, like a lot of Xena and other media from when I was a kid. There's a good argument that this is what the original sin, knowledge of good and evil, meant, that kind of blanket judgement of a person's value. But that doesn't deny that evil does exist within many of the ways that the world operates. If you look at the news and we're being honest, it probably won't take you that long to find something happening that you want to describe as evil. We know that evil exists.\n\n### God's Victory\n\nTo paraphrase something from G.K. Chesterton, which I believe I first encountered through Rachel Held Evans: the reason we tell fairytales is not to teach children that dragons exist. Children know soon enough that dragons exist, that the world can be scary, that evil happens. The reason we tell fairytales is to teach children that the dragons can be defeated. That's a big part of what I think is happening here in Ephesians. They knew the evil existed; what they needed to know was that it could be defeated.\n\nThe recipients of the letter were told they didn't need to be afraid of these evil powers anymore. They didn't need to be constantly resorting to their own magical efforts to try to contain them, because God already won.\n\nThis motif of Jesus defeating evil as well as death is a common one throughout the Pauline letters, as well as other texts like Revelation and Jesus' casting out demons in the Gospels. In the Adult Ed today, we'll look a bit at some other motifs in the New Testament for explaining exactly what was accomplished by Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. This is the most prominent one: that somehow Jesus defeated evil and death.\n\nI haven't completely dropped social media this year for Lent as I often have in the past, but I have tried to maintain stricter limits. I'm trying to find that balance of staying informed without being overwhelmed. That does mean that some days with how fast the news is changing that I miss about 6 stages of commentary on new tariffs, then counter tariffs, then a reversal of part of a tariff, then a delay of one tariff but another one added, then a reversal of part of the reversal from earlier in the day, and I'm very tired of the word tariff even with less social media.\n\nOne of the ways that I do feel overwhelmed when I spend too much time on social media soaking up every bit of bad news is that I want to know what I can do to defeat these evils. I want to jump to fixing the problem.\n\nThat gets me closer to the Ephesians' magical approach. They were trying to constrain evil through their own efforts, as I am often tempted to do. The message that they needed to hear was one of transcendent hope and grace. They were told to be confident in God's victory. It might not always look like it, but the victory is assured. It wasn't solely their job to defeat evil through sheer effort, with the right magical words or actions.\n\nI found myself thinking that this is the main message I needed to hear from the letter, too: I, alone, raging against the darkness, cannot fix everything. Fortunately, I am not alone.\n\nThis God does not sit back and wish us good luck defeating evil. This God has led the charge into the darkness. This God is one who entered the trenches, who has defeated evil and is defeating evil.\n\n### How: God's Armour\n\nThis passage is often referred to as the \"armour of God\" and that leaves upon a couple of possibilities for how to interpret the preposition \"of.\" Tom Yoder Neufeld unpacks this well in his commentary. He argues that it is a mistake to believe that it is God giving us necessary protection for our battles, like God is just the blacksmith. Instead, this is God's armour, the mechanisms by which God fights. This text, first and foremost, is saying what God is like and has done, summarizing a letter which has largely been about what God has done.\n\nI thought it was interesting in Marcus' message a few weeks ago when he mentioned how Paul and those others who wrote in his name get cast as legalistic. I've heard that version, that Paul is all about the harsh rules that we must follow. Therefore, they conclude, we need to dismiss him and everything he wrote. I've also heard the version that Paul is obsessed with a cheap empty version of grace, that God has already forgiven us no matter what we've done to hurt each other, so don't worry about things like social injustices that we are participating in. Therefore, Paul does not adequately prepare us to be capable of things like apologizing or learning to love people better. In conclusion, we should dismiss him and everything that he wrote. We've got one big chunk of people upset at Paul for one idea and another big chunk upset at Paul for the complete opposite idea.\nI think those two extremes are missing that there is a third option. According to this text, the battle is fought by \"putting on\" this new reality, this new way of being that was revealed most fully in Jesus. We are invited to inhabit the way of God, participating in God's battle with God's armour. This aligns with much of the other language of Ephesians to this point, about being the new creation in Christ. We don't fight our own battle through our own magical efforts, essentially the legalistic reading of Paul. We don't sit back and pretend there isn't a battle either, which is essentially the cheap grace reading of Paul.\n\nEach piece of armour, what God's new way of being looks like, could be its own sermon. These are big ideas: truth, peace, justice, and the word of God. We don't have time for that. Believe me, I was ready to give a rant on the concept of truth in the disinformation social media age. You've been spared from that with the time limits on these sermons, which I am pushing close to, so it is time to wrap up.\n\nThe main takeaway is that the church is called to a way of being that follows God's lead and stands in contrast to the powers. Where the powers use misinformation and disinformation to amass wealth and influence, God is truthful and calls the church to be truthful. Where the powers seek to divide and incite violence, God reconciles humanity and calls the church to be peacemakers. Where the world accepts injustice if it benefits them, God seeks justice for the most marginalized, even at cost to themself on the cross, and calls the church to do the same. This is who God is, that is how God defeats evil, and that is what we are invited to put on as well.\n\n## Resources\n\n### Books\n\nFlorer-Bixler, M.

There were a couple of key points that came up in his discussion of the \"God's Armour\" section which I used in the sermon.\n\n### Videos\n\nFor more on Artemis of Ephesus, here's [a good video from Religion for Breakfast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9IF4vE9UGE). That doesn't impact much about how we read Ephesians, but it is interesting as part of the setting where her worship was quite possibly part of what was meant within \"powers and principalities\" (the Clinton Arnold book cited above also discussed her place in Ephesian religion).\n","date":"2025-03-16T10:00:00.000Z"},"/2025/summer-lars-real-girl/":{"id":"/2025/summer-lars-real-girl/","title":"Summer Talk - Ryan and the Real Empathy Machine","description":"A looser summer talk about the power of story in Lars and the Real Girl","tags":"posts Sermon Movies and TV Church","content":"\nI gave this short talk at my church where we don't have the full and more formal services in the summer. Instead, we have shorter talks where a different person each week answers a themed question and then there is time for discussion. This is less formal (and shorter) than a typical sermon. The question this year was about a story that helped us learn something about God, the world, or people different than yourself.\n\n## Scripture Text\n\n[John 8:1-11 (CEB)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%208%3A1-11&version=CEB)\n\n## Transcript\n\nThe famous film critic Roger Ebert once said:\n\n> We are all born with a certain package. We are who we are. Where we were born, who we were born as, how we were raised. We are kind of stuck inside that person, and the purpose of civilization and growth is to be able to reach out and empathize a little bit with other people, find out what makes them tick, what they care about. For me, the movies are like a machine that generates empathy. If it's a great movie, it lets you understand a little bit more about what it's like to be a different gender, a different race, a different age, a different economic class, a different nationality, a different profession, different hopes, aspirations, dreams and fears. It helps us to identify with the people who are sharing this journey with us.\"\n> There's a movie podcast I listen to that references this idea often, as the \"empathy machine\" or the need for \"empathetic imagination.\n\nWe don't truly know what it is like to be someone else, but stories, movies or otherwise, can be a great tool to help build those empathetic imagination muscles.\n\nThere is some scientific backing to this. There are a couple things we know happen when we are engaged with a story.\n\nFirst, it wraps us up in it. It allows us to forget about our experiences for a time to imagine what it is like to be somebody else. We have to get ourselves out of the way a bit.\n\nAs we do that, mirror neurons kick in. When we see somebody else doing something, our mirror neurons fire as if we are doing it. That helps create empathy understanding them, as well as allows us to learn from watching others. Studies have shown that those neurons are firing when encountering a story. It is most powerful with personal stories with somebody you already know, but it is also true in mediated stories like watching a movie.\n\nCombined, this can give us a bigger picture of the world, setting aside my experience to imagine somebody else's. Stories can allow us to learn in ways that we wouldn't learn in a lecture.\n\n## Lars and the Real Girl\n\nMaybe the biggest example of this in my life is the movie _Lars and the Real Girl_. If you haven't seen it, I think you should, but I will recap the main plot.\n\nLars lives in the converted garage on the property with his brother Gus and sister-in-law Karin. He's very isolated and has some trauma.\n\nOne day he tells Gus and Karin that he has a girlfriend he met online, and she is coming to visit. Their excitement quickly fades when Bianca arrives and is a lifelike sex doll that Lars is treating as a human being. This could be a setup for a lot of punching down jokes at Lars' expense, but the movie doesn't take that easy route.\n\nInstead, Gus and Karin are advised by a psychologist that they should play along because Lars needs this to work out some things. But they aren't the only ones who play along. The entire small-town community gets on board. It becomes a story of how the community rallies around Lars and Bianca, by entering his reality, by showing radical empathy. They start inviting Bianca to things; she joins the PTA and volunteers at the hospital and is routinely out with the community one way or another. Lars starts accepting more opportunities to be engaged in the community as well. All of this helps Lars heal.\n\nThat community includes Gus and Karin, Lars' coworkers, and the church.\n\nIt is the church that gets a small but pivotal scene. Karin and Gus have gone to the church bible study group to enlist their help after hearing the advice of the psychologist.\n\nThe conversation captures a tension between wanting to hold to the obvious truth of the situation and doing what is uncomfortable but might be best for Lars, at least according to the psychologist. One man compares Lars to the story of worshipping the golden calf and declares that young people these days have no willpower. I found a script online that includes a few more lines to that effect. One member of the group worries that if they play along, they are encouraging bad habits. There is a \"shouldn't expose the children\" line, referring to letting Bianca come to church. But then, one of the characters exclaims \"what's the big deal\" and starts naming things a little strange or unhealthy or maybe even harmful about family members of others in the group that they've all been able to set aside that judgemental voice out of love for them. Many of us have been in conversations something like this at some point in our lives, dealing with that kind of tension.\n\nEventually they all turn to the pastor, who has been silent so far. He simply says, as the last line of the scene \"the question is, as always, what would Jesus do?\"\n\nThat's a line that could easily read as an empty cliché slogan. I grew up in the period when the WWJD was commoditized on bracelets and everything else. But in the context of the movie, as the final word of this serious debate, without even explicitly answering the question, it is surprisingly effective. In the next scene, Bianca is at church, and everybody is trying to play along, some better at it than others. After that there is little question about how they should be responding.\n\nI first watched this as a seminary student. I was scheduled to give a short talk as part of a chapel service the following week, but it was Friday night, and I was too tired to come up with an idea. I decided to give myself a break to watch what I thought was a light-hearted comedy.\n\nInstead, I got a beautiful story that provided me exactly what I needed for that chapel talk which became about the healing power of community. I actually won a cash award at the end of the year for \"evangelism\" which I was confused by, so I had to ask and I found out it was because of that chapel talk. That maybe tells you all you need to know about how little anybody talked about evangelism at my seminary, but I was not complaining about the cash award.\n\nMore importantly, it was a breakthrough for me.\n\nI have many positive things to say about my church growing up, and other communities through university undergrad. Many of the people there showed the same kind of compassion we see in this movie. But the most important thing in the teaching and in the songs was a particular understanding of the story of Jesus. A starting point for that understanding was that God is out there detached from us being the perfect judge of all right and wrong.\n\nFor a lot of reasons, that image had been crumbling for me for the previous few years and I had been doing a lot of reconstructing how I saw God. From the character we see in Jesus, I started seeing a lot more a God who enters humanity, including suffering with us. We could say that is a God who shows a radical empathy. That's a wildly different starting point.\nAnd here's the important part for the movie: when you think of God primarily as judge, detached out there, that's how you think you should be and how the church should be, too. The most important thing in any discussion is that you are clear about what is right and what is wrong. That's one half of that tension in that pivotal scene. In practice I experienced a lot of loving kind community in churches. But the concept of church was still largely talked about through the lens of learning to understand God better and to help others understand God better. It was about being right and correcting others who are not.\n\nI also was vaguely aware that there were other kinds of churches that seemed to be a different extreme, refusing to pass any kind of claim on truth, just being a nice social club, respectable middle-class people who already have their life perfect and would have a really hard time ever dealing with an addict or even somebody in dirty clothes coming straight from a night shift. That version didn't appeal to me either, where there didn't seem to be much substance.\n\nI came into watching this movie with an understanding of God that was a lot healthier, with this kind of radical incarnational empathy, but my understanding of the church hadn't caught up.\n\nThis movie, and especially this scene, hit at the exact right time in my life. Suddenly I could imagine a church, or community more widely, acting with this kind of radical empathy that I had begun to be able to see in the Jesus story. I probably had heard somebody say that is what the church should be like, but I couldn't really imagine it and it was not sinking in. But now I had seen it in story form and it suddenly clicked. They don't deny reality in the pursuit of being nice above all else. They still clearly understand what's really going on. But they realize that love for Lars means setting aside that judgement and entering his reality. The goal isn't to be nice. The goal isn't to be right. The goal is to embody that radical empathy we see in Jesus that brings about real healing.\n","date":"2025-07-06T10:30:00.000Z"},"/2025/meanings-sabbath/":{"id":"/2025/meanings-sabbath/","title":"Meanings of Sabbath","description":"Sabbath is a reminder of the character of God, our own worth, the rejection of constant power at the expense of others, and liberation for the marginalized.","tags":"posts Sermon","content":"\nOur church is planning a sermon series on Sabbath. We have a very democratic preaching approach, where speakers are largely free to take their message in whatever direction they want. This is no guarantee that this how the series will actually go at our church, but I figured since I sketched out one particular flow of the idea, I would turn that into a post here.\n\n## Week 1: Sabbath as Worship\n\nSabbath reminds us of the character of God, which I tend to argue is the most important theological question at the basis of everything else.\n\nThese are a couple possible texts:\n\nFrom Exodus 20:8-11:\n\n> 8 “Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. 9 Six days you shall labor and do all your work, 10 but the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns. 11 For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.\n\nAnd from Genesis 1:31-2:3:\n\n> 31 God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day. 2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array. 2 By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work. 3 Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done.\n\nThe Sabbath is to be observed because God made everything in 6 days and then rested, making the 7th day holy. This is a God who is immensely creative, but it’s not perpetual productivity for the sake of constant growth. This is a God who gets to the point of supporting relationship with humans and says \"ok, that’s very good, time to rest\" (even though presumably God does not need rest in the way that humans do). So, the Sabbath is to remember the presence of that kind of loving God who created a very good world.\n\n## Week 2: Sabbath as Rest\n\nIf this is a God who rests and who prioritizes relationship with us, that God also cares about our wellbeing including the need for regular rest. One text I noted for that idea was Matthew 11:28-12:14:\n\n> 28 “Come to me, all you who are struggling hard and carrying heavy loads, and I will give you rest. 29 Put on my yoke, and learn from me. I’m gentle and humble. And you will find rest for yourselves. 30 My yoke is easy to bear, and my burden is light.”\n> 12:1 At that time Jesus went through the wheat fields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry so they were picking heads of wheat and eating them. 2 When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, “Look, your disciples are breaking the Sabbath law.”\n> 3 But he said to them, “Haven’t you read what David did when he and those with him were hungry? 4 He went into God’s house and broke the law by eating the bread of the presence, which only the priests were allowed to eat. 5 Or haven’t you read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple treat the Sabbath as any other day and are still innocent? 6 But I tell you that something greater than the temple is here. 7 If you had known what this means, I want mercy and not sacrifice,[a] you wouldn’t have condemned the innocent. 8 The Human One is Lord of the Sabbath.”\n> Healing on the Sabbath\n> 9 Jesus left that place and went into their synagogue. 10 A man with a withered hand was there. Wanting to bring charges against Jesus, they asked, “Does the Law allow a person to heal on the Sabbath?”\n> 11 Jesus replied, “Who among you has a sheep that falls into a pit on the Sabbath and will not take hold of it and pull it out? 12 How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! So the Law allows a person to do what is good on the Sabbath.” 13 Then Jesus said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” So he did and it was made healthy, just like the other one. 14 The Pharisees went out and met in order to find a way to destroy Jesus.\n\nJesus says that his yoke is light. That doesn't mean that following the Way of Jesus is easy, but within this context of those being crushed by the world, his way will bring them rest. That transitions into one of a few stories of healing on the Sabbath and Jesus justifying that as because human lives are worth saving.\n\nSo, the Sabbath is a reminder of our worth. We need to take care of ourselves, including regular rest, but we also shouldn't ever feel like we are not good enough to have earned a rest. Our worth is simply in our humanity, not in being high enough up the societal scale of power.\n\n## Week 3: Sabbath as Resistance\n\nThis builds on that, and the one I will be preaching. In the Exodus versions of the Ten Commandments I noted above in week 1, it is clear that the Sabbath is also to be observed right down to slaves, animals, and immigrants living among them. That’s the radical part of it; the powerful can always rest because they can just make others do the work for them. That's true in the the Deuteronomy version of the Ten Commandments as well, but it also changes one other important thing. It gives a different reason why to observe the Sabbath: remember you were a slave in Egypt and God brought you out of it.\n\n> 12 Keep the Sabbath day and treat it as holy, exactly as the Lord your God commanded: 13 Six days you may work and do all your tasks, 14 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. Don’t do any work on it—not you, your sons or daughters, your male or female servants, your oxen or donkeys or any of your animals, or the immigrant who is living among you—so that your male and female servants can rest just like you. 15 Remember that you were a slave in Egypt, but the Lord your God brought you out of there with a strong hand and an outstretched arm. That’s why the Lord your God commands you to keep the Sabbath day. (Deuteronomy 5:12-15 CEB)\n\nThis newly freed people aren’t allowed to just turn around and repeat the same injustices on others now that they have some freedom. So, the Sabbath is a reminder not to fall into the trap of constantly trying to increase our power and wealth, pushing others down along the way.\n\n## Week 4: Sabbath as Liberation\n\nThe final week is the other side of the resistance coin. If Sabbath as resistance reminds us of what to say no to, what do we say yes to instead? One possible text is Luke 13:10-17:\n\n> 10 Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath. 11 A woman was there who had been disabled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and couldn’t stand up straight. 12 When he saw her, Jesus called her to him and said, “Woman, you are set free from your sickness.” 13 He placed his hands on her and she straightened up at once and praised God.\n> 14 The synagogue leader, incensed that Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, responded, “There are six days during which work is permitted. Come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath day.”\n> 15 The Lord replied, “Hypocrites! Don’t each of you on the Sabbath untie your ox or donkey from its stall and lead it out to get a drink? 16 Then isn’t it necessary that this woman, a daughter of Abraham, bound by Satan for eighteen long years, be set free from her bondage on the Sabbath day?” 17 When he said these things, all his opponents were put to shame, but all those in the crowd rejoiced at all the extraordinary things he was doing.\n\nUpdate: I've now realized that part of this overlaps with the Matthew text I put in week 2, so one of them would likely need to change.\n\nI noted that text when [Diana Butler Bass had a good post about it recently](https://dianabutlerbass.substack.com/p/sunday-musings-d8e) when it came up in the lectionary. There are probably a few other Jesus healing on the Sabbath stories that would work just as well.\n\nThe point is: most of the healing stories are not just curing physical ailments; they also provide social liberation to be reintegrated into community. I know some disability theology people do some good work on that distinction as well, emphasizing wanting to be treated as an equal member of the community whether or not the disability ever is \"cured.\" If we interpret Sabbath purely as \"rest no matter what\" then it is easy to turn that into a rule that stops you from doing that kind of liberation, but Jesus clearly took the side that liberating on the Sabbath is good and more in line with the real purpose. So, Sabbath is a reminder to imagine and work toward a more just world.\n\n## Tangent: Types of Justice Work\n\nThis process reminded me of another thing I encountered a while ago. I wish I remember the source, but I didn't take a note of it. It was in some book about the climate emergency. There was a point in there that brought up that there are (at least) four different categories of how we do work in the face of this emergency, and I think it is generally true of a lot of social issues. This is how I remembered them, which may or may not be entirely accurate:\n\n1. Reform: limiting the damage, working within existing systems. This may be the work of politicians (the good ones) and activists, for example, who generally cannot overhaul everything into a utopia overnight but who can identify those ways that current systems are causing harm and enact change to eliminate or at least blunt that harm.\n2. Healing and Restoration: aiding those who have already been harmed, to restore them back into society as soon as possible. This might look like a lot of great work from charities and non-profits who often aren't fixing the problem but are making sure that those hurt by it aren't abandoned.\n3. Resistance: directly calling out what is causing the harm, so people realize it is a problem that needs to be resolved. This might look like protests and petitions and calling your elected representatives.\n4. Alternative: modelling what an alternative system could look like. This is where, in my opinion, religious and other voluntary communities can truly shine, as they can demonstrate what it is like to live differently. Without this, it is hard for people to catch a vision of what even is the point of all this hard work.\n\nNone of these are ever sufficient on their own. For example, if we collectively only ever did reform without any others, we are limiting our imagination, allowing _some_ to be hurt because at least it is less than before. If you never do any reform, it's a constant uphill battle demanding an absolutely all or nothing sudden change which is usually not realistic. Importantly, that does not mean that each one of us individually needs to do all of them. We can't. It's too much and we will end up doing most of it badly. Instead, some of us should be really good at reform, some really good at healing, some really good at resistance, some really good at building alternatives. Pick your lane and celebrate those in other lanes, not looking down on them as some form of lesser work.\n\nI think about those fairly often, and I did again here, as all of those came up to some degree within the themes of what is accomplished by Sabbath well understood.\n","date":"2025-11-22T10:30:00.000Z"},"/2025/manger-misunderstanding/":{"id":"/2025/manger-misunderstanding/","title":"Adult Ed - Luke Birth Narratives","description":"From an Adult Education hour, some notes on the kingship language of the Luke birth narratives.","tags":"posts Adult Education Bible","content":"\nFor the first week of Advent, I led our church's Adult Education hour with a look at the birth narratives in Luke. Below is an adapted version of my notes.\n\n## Credit\n\nI'll start by noting that I am adapting most of this from [a course with Pete Enns in the Bible for Normal People network called A Manger Misunderstanding](https://thebiblefornormalpeople.com/classes/a-manger-misunderstanding/). It's only available with the paid subscription called The Society of Normal People. The network's name comes from that it really tries to be accessible to anybody. Pete and the others in the Bible for Normal People are good at getting serious scholarship across in very friendly ways. That's my plug for them to acknowledge that that's where most of the content for today came from.\n\nI basically listened through his presentation that was about an hour plus Q&A time and tried to shrink that into about half an hour, put it into my own voice a little more, added a little room for it to be more interactive, and added a couple of other tangents.\n\n## Comparing the Gospels\n\nFirst, Pete points out some of the differences between the Gospels. Matthew and Luke are the two Gospels that have birth narratives in them.\n\nMatthew primarily presents Jesus as the new Moses. There's the story of Herod massacring the innocent children, mirroring what Pharoah did around the birth of Moses. There's a story of escaping Egypt. That emphasis continues a lot throughout Matthew, commonly accepted as the most Jewish Gospel, where Jesus is largely presented as a new revelation or new law or new wisdom (as I heard Diana Butler Bass say recently, not just a wisdom teacher but wisdom itself) within the Jewish story. All the Gospel writers are Jewish, writing about a Jewish Jesus, but Matthew leans in the hardest with the parallels to other figures from Jewish history.\n\nLuke on the other hand puts more emphasis on Jesus as the true Caesar. The birth narratives, and the Gospel as a whole, are a lot more concerned with how this Jesus movement interacts within the wider Roman Empire political moment. Jesus is a new king with a completely different kind of kingdom compared to Caesar. It is Luke that we are focusing on today, so we'll see a lot of this theme of kingship, which was teased nicely for me last week with some Christ the King Sunday comments.\n\n## Narrative 1: Gabriel's Announcement to Mary\n\nHere's the first text, from Luke 1:30-35 (NRSVUE):\n\n> 30 The angel said to her, \"Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. 31 And now, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you will name him Jesus. 32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his ancestor David. 33 He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.\" 34 Mary said to the angel, \"How can this be, since I am a virgin?\" 35 The angel said to her, \"The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be holy; he will be called Son of God.\n\nI had someone else read it out loud once. Then I'm going to give you about a couple minutes to read it again and think about it. Sometimes we need to read slowly to really notice things, especially if you are familiar with the story. I want you to think about what phrases stand out to you. Maybe you've never noticed them before. Maybe you have heard a lot about them in the past. What do you think they mean? What do you think that Luke is trying to get across by including them? And I want to give enough time for my fellow introverts to really have a chance to think about it before you start sharing with the rest of the group, so after it was read out once, I waited a couple minutes of silence.\n\nI then took any comments about what stood out to them. Interestingly, the answers were mostly not what Pete Enns drew attention to. Instead, the main theme that emerged was the one of fear, with Mary being told not to be afraid, and even the language of \"overshadow\" which is not the most friendly term to Mary's agency (at least in this English translation). Even though that is not what Pete was looking at, I did think it was an interesting complementary theme, because the instinct with all this king language is to assume a dominating powerful God. Luke goes on to subvert that assumption, but there's a good start by pointing out that the real God is not one who needs to be feared in that way.\n\nPete points out 6 phrases, with 2 slight variations on 3 themes:\n\n- \"Son of the Most High\" and \"Son of God.\" We've got one theme of the connection between Jesus and God.\n- \"Throne of his ancestor David\" and \"House of Jacob.\" We've got a connection to one of the patriarchs and the most famous king, anchored in the Jewish story.\n- \"Forever\" and \"no end.\" We've got the idea that this is a permanent promise.\n\nFor some of you, this might already be confusing, so I'm going to backtrack and give a really big overview of the history of Israel up to this point.\n\nMost of the history of the Israelites in the Bible they are subject to some powerful Empire or another – Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Greece, and now Rome.\n\nThere are really two exceptions to this. The big one is after Egypt, when they have returned to the land and have political sovereignty. This peaks with David and his son Solomon, then declines from there until they are right back until control of another Empire. David and Solomon is the golden era. This is what they are most nostalgic for. A lot of their prophetic literature is about restoring that kind of Golden Age when they had sovereignty, free of imperial oppression, with their own king again.\n\nThe other period they were free from imperial rule was a brief but more recent one. They successfully got free of the Greek Empire under the leadership of the Maccabees, but it didn't last long. Some of this period is in those books that are in Catholic and Orthodox Bibles but not in Protestant ones. When some of the prophetic literature of this time is saying that they will have a king of Israel again forever, I imagine that they are thinking of that recent glimpse of freedom that didn't last long.\n\nThat ties in the \"forever\" and the King David connections. What about the other one, the connection to God? Pete shows some parallels in other texts where kings are called things like \"Son of God\" and told that their reign will be forever. This text in Luke is echoing a lot of that language.\n\nOf course, over Christian history, the language of \"son of God\" also came to mean that Jesus is a part of God, one of the three persons of the Trinity. There are other texts that make a stronger case for that, but that's not the main point here.\n\nThat kind of language here was simply something you would say to identify a king, and the rest of this text is very clearly aligning Jesus as a king a lot like David, a political leader over a free Israel, forever.\n\n## Narrative 2: Prophecy of Zechariah\n\nThe next story is the prophecy to Zechariah, from Luke 1:67-79:\n\n> 67 Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:\n> 68 \"Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,\n> for he has looked favorably on his people and redeemed them.\n> 69 He has raised up a mighty savior for us\n> in the house of his child David,\n> 70 as he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from of old,\n> 71 that we would be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us.\n> 72 Thus he has shown the mercy promised to our ancestors\n> and has remembered his holy covenant,\n> 73 the oath that he swore to our ancestor Abraham,\n> to grant us\n> 74 that we, being rescued from the hands of our enemies,\n> might serve him without fear, 75 in holiness and righteousness\n> in his presence all our days.\n> 76 And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High,\n> for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,\n> 77 to give his people knowledge of salvation\n> by the forgiveness of their sins.\n> 78 Because of the tender mercy of our God,\n> the dawn from on high will break upon us,\n> 79 to shine upon those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,\n> to guide our feet into the way of peace.\"\n\nI again had it read out loud once.\n\nMy questions for this one: First, what phrases are naming a problem? What phrases are naming a solution that God is going to do about it?\n\nHere's how Pete summarized it:\n\n- The problem: their enemies rule over them, including wielding the power of death against them.\n- What God is going to do about it: looking favorably on them and remembering them to bring salvation, mercy, forgiveness, light, and peace.\n\nLike \"Son of God,\" a lot of the language here has come to mean different things over centuries of Christian history. A lot of these things that God is doing often gets used now as salvation from sin so we can all go to Heaven when we die. Like \"Son of God,\" I'm not refuting all those ideas also being true and there are other texts that support them better. In this text, though, remember the other half that Pete is identifying: the problem here is that Israel has enemies. They are under Roman occupation. These solutions wouldn't help with that problem if we were only talking about what God is going to do after we've died. Zechariah's prophecy, as relayed by Luke, suggests that Jesus will free them from that occupation. Even the forgiveness of sins language in that context would be understand as a communal forgiveness, cleansing the community so that they are holy when God does send the promised king. Those ideas go together. It isn't some separate \"and also you can go to Heaven.\"\n\nSo the point again: Jesus is the real king, but more than the first text, we start to see how this means there is a conflict with Rome. If Jesus is the king, Caesar is not. So far, this is becoming more threatening to Rome but it is still completely normal for Jewish writing.\n\n## Narrative 3: Angels and Shepherds\n\nThis is the text that is probably the most familiar to you, because it is often in Christmas pageants, and a lot of it are themes that we've already touched on. But here it is again, from Luke 2:8-15:\n\n> 8 Now in that same region there were shepherds living in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. 9 Then an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. 10 But the angel said to them, \"Do not be afraid, for see, I am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people: 11 to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is the Messiah, the Lord. 12 This will be a sign for you: you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger.\" 13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying,\n> 14 \"Glory to God in the highest heaven,\n> and on earth peace among those whom he favors!\"\n> 15 When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, \"Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, which the Lord has made known to us.\"\n\nThere are a couple of interesting things here:\n\nFor one, there is ambiguity in \"all the people\" and \"among those whom he favors.\" Who does that mean? Does that mean all the Jewish people, or the entire world, or Christians that don't exist yet, or some other subset of humanity? Pete suggests that it is intentionally ambiguous so that it would feel familiar to Jewish readers thinking that is obviously about them. But it is ambiguous enough that it also teases that over the course of the Gospel, as well as Acts written by Luke as well, we will see a lot more opening up that it is really means everybody. Luke is starting from Jewish expectations and Jewish prophetic language of kingship but pushing them in a more inclusive direction.\n\nAnother interesting phrase here is \"Heavenly host\" which is militaristic language, but then they proclaim peace. I think this leads into what Pete brings up next, the Priene Calendar Inscription:\n\n> Providence [a god], which has ordered all things and is deeply interested in our life, has set in most perfect order by giving us Augustus, whom she filled with virtue that he might benefit humankind, sending him as a SAVIOR both for us and for our descendants, that he might end war and arrange all things. He, Caesar, by his appearance (excelled even our anticipations), surpassing all previous benefactors, and not even leaving to posterity any hope of surpassing what he has done. The birthday of the god Augustus was the beginning of the good tidings for the world that came by reason of him which Asia resolved in Smyrna.\n\nThis is from not long before Jesus' birth, about 9 BCE. You might recognize some of this language from the other text that we just read. It has a lot of the same things to say, but it is about Caesar being a saviour sent by a god, who would bring peace and good tidings for the world, for all time. It doesn't say it in here, but the audience knows that how Caesar does that is through conquest, through bringing everything under the control of the Empire.\n\nThis text with the Shepherds then, is also building on the conflict between Jesus and Caesar. Rome says these things about Caesar, but Jewish people know that Caesar's definition of peace is oppression for them. On the other hand, Luke says it is actually true about Jesus. Luke is saying that Jesus is the true ruler of everything, not Caesar. In addition to the conflict with Caesar, we're starting to see here that it might apply to more than just Israel. Caesar didn't rule over just Israel; he ruled over the entire known world.\n\n## Narrative 4: Anna and Simeon\n\nThis one I ended up having to cut for time, but I'll still share my notes here. The text is from Luke 2:25-33, 36-38:\n\n> 25 Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; this man was righteous and devout, looking forward to the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit rested on him. 26 It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Messiah. 27 Guided by the Spirit, Simeon came into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what was customary under the law, 28 Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying,\n> 29 \"Master, now you are dismissing your servant in peace,\n> according to your word,\n> 30 for my eyes have seen your salvation,\n> 31 which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,\n> 32 a light for revelation to the gentiles\n> and for glory to your people Israel.\"\n> 33 And the child's father and mother were amazed at what was being said about him.\n> 36 There was also a prophet, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was of a great age, having lived with her husband seven years after her marriage, 37 then as a widow to the age of eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshiped there with fasting and prayer night and day. 38 At that moment she came and began to praise God and to speak about the child to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.\n\nSome key things that Pete points out:\n\nOne is this language of \"consolation of Israel.\" It is used previously in the Bible, like so many of the other phrases we've been looking. In this case, it means the end of the Babylonian Exile and the return to the land of Israel. That seems like a generic comforting phrase to us, but in that context it would bring to mind some of their other older texts written in a previous context of returning from an exile into Empire, and they are now reading it while under the control of another Empire.\n\nPete cites NT Wright here. Wright says that when Israel went into exile, they lost 3 major things: their land, their temple, and their king. When they came back, they got the land back, then they built a new temple, but a few hundred years later and they still have not gotten their king back. That's the messianic hope, to bring back the good old days of having a king again. They haven't really had the full consolation – the full return from Exile - until that king is in place.\n\nThe word \"Messiah\" is also used here. That simply means \"anointed one.\" The Greek equivalent is Christ. It's not a unique term for Jesus, though. It was used for people who were anointed for many reasons, including most notably kings.\n\nThen there is a bit in here that is like the \"all people\" ambiguity that was in the previous text. See that bit about the light for revelation to the Gentiles? That seems to be echoing Isaiah 49:6, which is talking about the return from Exile. Pete argues that in Isaiah this probably meant that there will be a light to find the missing Israelites who had dispersed into the other nations as part of the Exile, not saying the other nations were to be saved as well. Here, Luke's quoting it is still ambiguous enough that it could go either way. But Luke quotes it again later in Acts and there he explicitly uses it to mean that Gentiles are included in the salvation. But as of this point in the birth narrative, it seems like more intentional ambiguity, where Jewish readers would think it means one thing but then over the course of the story it expands into a much bigger thing.\n\nAnna's prophecy is similar but with the language of redemption instead of consolation. That also invokes the language of coming back from Exile in some older texts. The Exile would finally come to a true end with a real king and Luke is arguing that Jesus is that true king, not Caesar.\n\n## Luke's Big Point\n\nThe big point here is that up to this point of Luke's telling, and remember this is just the introduction to the Gospel, all of this makes complete sense within a first century Jewish framework. There's a lot of invoking that Jesus is the true king, not Caesar. Jesus will finally free them from Exile, from imperial domination, by reestablishing sovereignty with their own king chosen by God. There are a couple little hints that a big twist is coming, with some of the language about all people and intentionally invoking language used for Caesar who ruled over the whole known world, not just the Jewish part of it. Otherwise, this is all expected for first century Judaism.\n\nI want to go back to a different Hebrew Bible story. In 1 Samuel 8, it is the people who demand a king from God, via the prophet Samuel. God says, no, trust me, you really don't want a king. Kings will tax you heavily and make your children slaves to make themselves richer. It won't be good for you, and you'll end up crying out to God for liberation. The people say they want a king anyway, because they want to be like other nations who have kings that go out and fight battles against other nations. They want that imperial framework of somebody ruling over them and trying to expand territory by exploiting others. God gives in and they get their kings. Guess what? The way of kings and empires didn't work out well for them, and most of the rest of the Hebrew Bible is the people calling out for liberation from one of the other Empires that took over. But even then, a lot of that calling out for help was still in the language of wanting another king.\n\nWhat I think is fascinating here when we get to the Jesus part of the story is that God essentially says \"fine, here's your new king. All that prophetic language, all that hope about having somebody to free them from Roman occupation, I'm about to fulfill it... But I'm going to do it in a completely different way than you expect.\"\n\nThis is why you get some who are frustrated with Jesus in later stories, like Judas Iscariot giving up and betraying him, because Jesus is walking around talking about loving Roman enemies instead of starting the war to free Israel from them. They have a lot of expectations for this Messianic king who would save them, and for the most part in these birth narrative texts, Luke is leaning into those expectations. One member of our congregation is a novel writer, and she pointed out in our conversation that it's a common tactic to start a story by establishing something relatable to the audience. Once they've entered into the story, then you can start to push them in new directions.\n\nBut there are big twists coming in the story:\n\nJesus has no interest in the political Jerusalem throne. A couple chapters later in Luke 4, Luke even has Satan offering the thrones of the world to Jesus and Jesus rejects it. A lot of readers at that time would probably be confused, because we just had all this build up about how Jesus is supposed to be the King of Israel. Now Luke says that the way that the world does kingship is actually Satan and Jesus is doing something completely different. Right after that, Jesus says he is there to proclaim good news to the poor, freedom for prisoners, sight for the blind. That's not the stuff kings like Caesar and Herod do.\n\nThat big twist continues throughout the story. Jesus' version of kingship includes crucifixion. That's death at the hands of the evil Empire that he is supposed to be overthrowing. Luke has been telling us repeatedly in these birth narratives that Caesar is not the true king, that Jesus is. And then an agent of Caesar kills Jesus, in the most brutal and shameful way possible. By the normal ways of thinking about the world, that would definitely suggest that Caesar won this battle of kings; he's the one with all the armies and still alive. But then there's resurrection, which says that even though Caesar can wield death, God has the final word.\n\nLuke intentionally builds up that Jesus is the promised king, the real Caesar. But then he completely flips what that means. Jesus' kingship is an upside-down kind of power, one that sacrifices for others and calls everyone, even enemies, into a way of love.\n\n## Should We Use the Language of King?\n\nThere was something said last week for Christ the King Sunday about how a lot of Mennonites don't like using the language of Jesus as king because the language of king implies a lot of that power ruling over and exploiting others that we reject specifically because Jesus shows us a better way of being. So, I'm going to open this up again to all of you: what do we do with all this king language in 2025 Canada, in a very different context? Do we try to avoid it completely? Do we fully embrace it? Something in between?\n\nIn a lot of contexts, I tend to agree that it might introduce more problems than it solves. If there isn't time to unpack the ways that Jesus completely subverts the idea of kingship the way that I just have, or that Luke does over the course of the Gospel, it is probably better to not use the language. You just end up with a lot of people making bad assumptions that Jesus is the kind of violent dominating ruler like so many human leaders past and present. Those kinds of assumptions based on the language used without any extra context is part of how you can get Christian nationalism. One thing I've started doing a lot more is replacing \"the Kingdom of God\" with \"the Way of Jesus.\" It's simple and clear what it means, and the early church did use some similar language.\n\nBut my biggest counterpoint is the other side of that coin. That language is there, in the Bible a lot as well as in some hymns and other Christian works over the centuries. If we don't at least occasionally remind ourselves that this is a subversion of the idea of kingship, not an embracing of that idea, that's how we end up with things like Christian nationalism who can't see the conflict between those two words. I do think we need to be able to say, \"no kings but Jesus,\" meaning that we reject the ways of violent dominating empire because we have accepted the way of Jesus instead. If you've completely rejected the language entirely, there's no opportunity to do that subversion, to draw attention to that contrast, and that is a contrast that we really need to be able to name one way or another.\n","date":"2025-11-30T11:00:00.000Z"},"/2026/sabbath-resistance/":{"id":"/2026/sabbath-resistance/","title":"Sermon - Move Slow and Fix Things","description":"A sermon about the importance of Sabbath as resistance to the constant fear and dehumanization of Empire.","tags":"posts Sermon","content":"\n## Scripture Texts\n\n- [Deuteronomy 5:12-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%205%3A12-15&version=CEB)\n- [Exodus 1:8-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%201%3A8-14&version=CEB)\n- [Exodus 5:6-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%205%3A6-9&version=CEB)\n- [Matthew 6:25-34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206%3A25-34&version=CEB)\n\n## Video\n\n\n\n## Transcript\n\n### Intro: Recapping The Series So Far\n\nWe're up to the third of four weeks in a series about Sabbath. This is already the second time in this series that you've heard a version of the Ten Commandments used as one of the Scripture texts. Bert also used a very similar text a couple weeks ago, but his was from Exodus.\n\nIn the Exodus version, the reason for the Sabbath was given as:\n\n> 11 Because the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and everything that is in them in six days, but rested on the seventh day. That is why the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.\n\nSabbath there in Exodus is linked to the creation poem. It is a reminder that this is a God who is immensely creative, but it's not perpetual productivity for the sake of constant growth. This is a God who gets to the point of supporting abundant relationship with humans and says \"ok, that's very good, time to rest.\" So, the Sabbath is to remember the presence of that loving God who created a very good world.\n\nWhat is most clear and the same between the two Ten Commandment texts is what you are supposed to do: rest. That was Marlene's topic last week. The Sabbath is a reminder of the worth of humanity. We need to take care of ourselves, including regular rest. Our worth, our being loved by that creative God, is simply in our humanity.\n\nI recap those ideas because I think they are the important basis to continue building to this week's topic, Sabbath as Resistance.\n\n### Rest for All\n\nHere's another big idea that is in both versions of the Sabbath command: the command to rest applies to everybody. It's for you, your children, your servants, your animals, and immigrants living among you. The Deuteronomy version even repeats the servant part a second time, in case you didn't catch it the first.\n\nI think we need to pause for a second to recognize that's the radical part. It's never been radical that those with wealth and power take regular rest. A quote I saw going around social media said, \"modern luxury is the ability to think clearly, sleep deeply, move slowly & live quietly in a society designed to prevent all four.\" Rest is often presented as a luxury for those with enough privilege to get away with it.\n\nThis leads into how the Deuteronomy text diverges the most from the Exodus one. Once we get to WHY the Sabbath is commanded, it's a completely different reason:\n\n> 15 Remember that you were a slave in Egypt, but the Lord your God brought you out of there with a strong hand and an outstretched arm. That's why the Lord your God commands you to keep the Sabbath day.\n\nThe Exodus version links the command to the creation poem and God's rest. This one links the idea of Sabbath to the story of God's rescuing the people from slavery in Egypt, a time when they could not rest.\n\nGod says, \"you cannot do that to yourselves again or inflict it on others again.\" The inclusion of servants and immigrants and even animals in the rest is explicitly discouraging using a religious rule as an excuse to exploit others. It is not \"I have to rest, therefore you, slave, should do it for me.\" That would be easy and common, just another way for those with the privilege to rest to push down those others who do not have that privilege. It would be the same as Egypt did to them, but now they're at the top of the pyramid of power instead of the bottom. Instead, the command says, \"I have to rest and I have to honour your rest, too, especially when you have less power than me like a servant or an immigrant.\"\n\nIt is a statement of resistance to the way of Pharaoh that God has just brought them out of.\n\n## Fear and Dehumanization\n\nSo, let's follow the reference in this Deuteronomy version back to what they are being told to remember, that time as slaves in Egypt. I went back to start at Exodus 1, which seemed like a logical place to start the story of the exodus.\n\nThere's a big idea in here that I had overlooked in other times reading it. Sometimes you don't notice something until you start to really sit with it for a sermon, and then it seems obvious in hindsight. It's honestly one of the best things about doing this once or twice a year.\n\nThe entire explanation for why Pharaoh decided to enslave a whole group of people was because he was afraid of them. The Israelites weren't even doing anything scary, as far as the text says at least. There is no inciting incident mentioned of the Israelites first expressing a desire to overthrow Egyptian leadership. But Pharaoh got scared that there were \"too many\" people who were different than him. Without any more reason than that, he becomes afraid that he will no longer hold all the power over them.\n\nHe did what anybody who is driven by fear of losing power does; he tries to reassert his power by flexing it against them. You know, it's kind of like when one world leader points out that another world leader is unreliable and just likes to throw power around to benefit himself. Then that second world leader responds with threats and publicly kicking the first world leader out of the club of the super cool leaders who give the second world leader money and promise to never say mean things about him. The second world leader is kind of proving the first world leader's point. _heavy sarcasm_ Obviously this is purely hypothetical, definitely not the kind of thing that happens every day now.\n\nAnyway, when throwing power around doesn't work to calm Pharaoh's fears, he escalates even more, and the Egyptians started looking at the Israelites with \"disgust and dread.\" In other words, they start viewing them as less human and needing to be enslaved. It was all because Pharaoh was afraid that the mere presence of difference would threaten his power.\n\nThose who already have a lot of power and privilege are often terrified of human difference and try hard to convince us that we should be, too. They cannot imagine a world that is not governed by a desire to rule over those who are different. That means difference itself is a threat that requires escalating violence to contain. They might think they will be happy and feel secure as soon as they assert just a little bit more control, but they never will. Because the real problem was not people being different. It was their fear, and they've put themselves in this cycle of becoming increasingly afraid.\n\n### The Quest for More Power\n\nAs we proceed forward to chapter 5, we see another related factor in Pharaoh's motivation. He makes the Israelites produce just as many bricks but refuses to give them straw to be able to do it. There are a couple of ways we could read this:\n\nMy first instinct was to assume that there is no way Pharaoh genuinely believed that the Israelites could make just as many bricks with less resources. Therefore, he must have just been doing it to be cruel and to feel more powerful by comparison. That's textbook bullying behaviour. We certainly see a lot of that in the news, too.\n\nBut then I remember how this all started with fear of difference leading to dehumanization. In Exodus 5:9, after Moses and Aaron have asked basically for a weekend off to worship God, Pharaoh says to \"make the men's work so hard that it's all they can do, and they can't focus on these empty lies.\" He wants to scrub away any kind of humanity that they are still trying to claim, any reason for their existence, like a God that cares about them. He wants them to only exist to make bricks for his profit.\n\nNow we see how the dehumanization and the seeking of more power go hand in hand. This cycle might get started from either direction, but once it starts, the two pieces can keep feeding into each other.\n\nIt makes me think maybe Pharaoh really did believe he could squeeze out a little bit more profit. If the Israelites aren't human in his eyes, if they purely exist for his gain, why not save a little bit more by not providing materials? That seems consistent with Pharaoh's mindset. It's also consistent in how a lot of big corporations operate today, trying to sap out every bit of value for their shareholders no matter how much it hurts their customers.\n\nThis feedback loop of fear and rationalizing hurting others for profit is easiest to see with the wealthiest among us. You don't get to be super rich without exploiting some people along the way. The more you exploit, the more detached you become and the more comfortable it is to do it even more.\n\nBut it's not just a problem for the super rich. It is a temptation for all of us.\n\nIn fact, in many cases, for those super rich to profit off the work of others, they need the rest of us to operate off a similar mindset. We get a lot of effort and money thrown at us to try to suck us farther into that destructive loop, to try to convince us that we need to play that same game of climbing over others to get to the top.\n\nWe will get the politicians and the thinktanks pushing narratives that we need to be afraid of anybody who is different than us. We are reassured that it is okay, probably even good, to hurt those others.\n\nWe'll get a lot of advertising telling us how we are not complete if we don't pursue having more power and wealth for ourselves. Those ads will even be personalized now, using a couple decades of mining everything we do online for data to make sure those ads hit as close as possible to our deepest insecurities. If you just buy this, your life will be better. Don't slow down enough to consider that it means you'd have less to share generously with those that really need it. Don't even think about those things that probably should be a higher priority for yourself. Sabbath is one act of resistance to this, but I'll briefly put on my tech person hat to say: so is installing an ad blocker on your devices. Seriously, do it.\n\nEven the concept of rest itself can get hijacked to further the push for more productivity. Some of the smarter managers will say that if you need a break, that is allowed within reason, but primarily so that you can be more productive later. We need rest because that's actually how we get the most done in the long run. This argument goes all the way back to Aristotle. It's also scientifically true; that is how we get the most done in the long run. But I think that argument comes up short of the picture of Sabbath being painted here. That's still the Pharaoh mindset that we exist primarily for production, just with an extra little note about how to optimize that production.\n\nAbraham Joshua Heschel in his classic work on the Sabbath said the same. Heschel argues that \"to the biblical mind, however, labor is the means toward an end, and the Sabbath as a day of rest, as a day of abstaining from toil, is not for the purpose of recovering one's lost strength and becoming fit for the forthcoming labor. The Sabbath is a day for the sake of life.\" The biblical framing of the Sabbath flips the more productivity version completely on its head. We don't observe Sabbath for the sake of being more productive. We are productive for the sake of being able to observe Sabbath, where we have a chance to resonate with our true humanity.\n\nJust as Pharaoh tried to cut away the humanity of the Israelites, there are a lot of pressures on us to strip away our own humanity. We are constantly encouraged, in ways both subtle and sometimes obvious, to just be good producers and consumers. Like Pharaoh said, we are supposed to work so hard that it's all we can do, and we can't focus on ideas like a God who loves us just as we are and wants to liberate us from oppression.\n\n### Jesus on Resisting Scarcity\n\nJesus offered some wisdom about trying to reclaim some humanity in the face of this destructive cycle as well, including in the Matthew 6 text.\n\nHe says instead of scarcity and a need to constantly push for more at the expense of others, God offers abundance. God provides enough for the birds of the air, the grass, the lilies, and will do the same for you. It's a reaffirmation of the creation poem's claim that God made the world very good.\n\nIn one sense, this is very simple and straightforward. There are two opposite things. One of them is destructive. The other affirms our humanity and the humanity of others around us. Pick the good one.\n\nSometimes I think that the Bible's language makes stuff like this sound too straightforward. Similarly, in a lot of churches, one of the common baptismal vows is something about renouncing Satan and all his works. Sometimes I think there's not enough nuance about good and evil and the complexities of the world in that kind of language.\n\nThen there are times where I hear the latest update on the authoritarian police state conducting kidnappings, torture, murder, and the dismantling of every human right we hold dear. Then I see resistance to this reality, like when thousands of people are out in -26\\*C Minneapolis weather. In one location about 100 clergy were simply kneeling and praying out in the freezing cold, until they got arrested. Moments like that make me think that sometimes it really can be that clear what it looks like to renounce Satan and all his works. We need the nuance and certainly the love for enemies when we're talking about specific people caught up in those evil systems, and we did see some of that, too, like the story of the woman who saved the life of the ICE agent who had arrested her. But we need unashamed clarity in renouncing those evil systems, too.\n\nSabbath is one of our tools to do that renouncing. There's a good argument that Friday's general strike and protests in Minneapolis was the best embodiment of this component of Sabbath I have ever seen. They chose to sacrifice work productivity and at least a chance at some comfort inside, to reclaim their humanity and the humanity of those being attacked the most. They chose to set aside all the reasons why they could have opted out.\n\nThat shows it isn't a simple \"just choose better.\" That must have been really hard. I had a hard enough time walking from the bus stop to work on Friday after I missed a transfer, and it wasn't even as cold here.\n\nIt's also slow work. It won't always look like progress immediately.\n\nBut one essential component of what makes all that really hard and slow work possible is that they did it together. At minimum you're going to need to be able to fight that battle against the fear and scarcity thinking alongside others trying to do the same.\n\nSabbath and \"church\" are not strictly the same thing. They're not even the same day of the week. Plus, for a church like ours that relies on a lot of volunteers every week, often it doesn't even feel like the usual definition of rest. Marlene touched on this well last week, including doing a good job challenging that maybe we need to expand our concept of rest. But like Sabbath, what church can do is remind us of a few important ideas like that a creative God loves us just as we are and provides enough for us. It can also sometimes get very practical helping each other with questions like budgets and how to align those to our real values. Or from me as a tech guy, it might be helping you with things like using an ad blocker or finding alternatives to relying on US Big Tech companies. I've spent a lot of time recently thinking about that last one.\n\nI will not always get it right. You will not always get it right. We as a collective will not always get it right. Sometimes we will hurt ourselves or others when we fall into those traps of fear and scarcity. Sometimes we'll find ourselves going along with an oppressive system because it is those other people who we barely think of as humans being hurt, not our people. Sometimes we will forget the way of Sabbath and fall back into the way of Pharaoh.\n\n### Conclusion: Sabbath as Resistance\n\nWhen that happens, we are lovingly invited back into Sabbath again and into community again. We are invited back toward a God that loves us in all our messy and sometimes unproductive humanity. There's a reason why Sabbath is a weekly discipline, not a one-time miracle fix.\n\nWe still need those regular reminders as much as ever. Those temptations are realities of our world today just as much as they were at the time the laws about Sabbath were being handed down. If anything, it all seems to be going faster by the year. The world often demands that we \"move fast and break things\" to reference an old Facebook mantra.\n\nIn the face of these realities, Sabbath becomes an act of resistance. It is a way of saying \"no\" to those things that we desperately need to say no to.\n\nSabbath can remind us of the slower but much more important work of being human together. Maybe instead of moving fast and breaking things, the way of God often looks a lot more like moving slow and fixing things.\n\n## Deleted Scenes\n\nThese were segments that got cut for time.\n\n### The Shabbos Goy Approach\n\nThis is related to the idea about Sabbath being for everyone, not just the observant Jews.\n\nThis raises one of the first questions for me. If like in the Exodus text, Sabbath is ONLY about worshipping God, then why would it apply to animals? Animals don't worship the Israelite God or any other god as far as we know. Even most immigrants are probably not worshipping the Israelite God. They don't care that the Israelite creation poem says a god they don't believe in rested on that day. If the purpose of the Sabbath is for the faithful worshippers to devote their time to their God, it would honestly make more sense that it would be a perfect chance to let the animals and the immigrants and the servants pick up the slack while you're doing your worship.\n\nI know some modern versions of Judaism do take this approach. There are many things they will not do on the Sabbath but if a Gentile is visiting, the Gentile can do it for them. There's even a term for it, the Shabbos goy, or Sabbath Gentile. That does best fit our postmodern sensibilities, too, where we generally believe that just because we believe a practice applies to us from our religious tradition doesn't mean that we should apply it to others.\nBut that is missing one of the big components that is conveyed more by the Deuteronomy text…\nCategories of Actions\n\nThis idea was in place in a few different spots of the sermon before being cut entirely, but I had wanted to expand on the place of being able to say \"no\" to things.\nA while ago I was listening to an audiobook about the climate crisis. I don't even remember the name of the book unfortunately, but there one thing that came up that really stuck with me. It was the idea that there are a few different ways of working toward making the world a little bit better, about climate or about lots of other things.\n\n1. Reform: working within existing systems to help mitigate the damage. You might think of that as some of our better politicians or public servants helping prepare policy, for example.\n2. Healing or charity: helping restore those who have already been hurt by whatever harmful system we're talking about. Lots of non-profits will fall in that category.\n3. Direct resistance: naming the evil thing that is happening, drawing attention to it so others are aware, including those who might be unknowingly participating in it or who do sort of know but find ways to rationalize it to themselves. You can think of protests or petitions.\n4. Building an alternative: showing that a better way of being is possible and inviting people into it. In that climate category it might be something like a solar energy coop, showing that you don't need to invest in fossil fuels.\n\nImportantly, we don't need to all do all of them all of the time. It's too much. You're not going to do it all well. We probably mostly need to pick one or two areas that we really care about and can do some good in, find some community that is working on doing that on an ongoing basis, and really invest some focused energy on that. That's a lot more effective than constantly bouncing around between whatever is trending on social media that day.\n\nAnyway, my general experience in Mennonite or other Anabaptist churches is that we like a lot of the building an alternative category, other than maybe not always being so good at inviting others into it. And we have a pretty good dose of healing or charity as well, as most churches do. We mostly opt out of reform and out of direct resistance, which often comes out of wanting to maintain some separation from the ways of the world. It is generally true that I do not like to spend more time than I have to on the things that we are saying \"no\" to, those things that we are opposing. Especially in a sermon, I usually do see the primary function as being inviting people into that better alternative, that thing that we say yes to.\n\nMy challenge in how we drew up this series is to slow down enough to spend some time unpacking what we need to resist, some of the evils that we need to say no to, allowing the more positive alternative to remain for Carrie next week.\n\n### Enshittification\n\nThis came as an expansion on the idea of the pursuit of profit sometimes being to such an extreme that it is even hurting the users.\n\nCory Doctorow has coined the term enshittification. If you'd prefer, you can call it crapification or platform decay. It was initially meant to describe specifically how technology platforms decline over time. First, the vendors creating the platform are focused on making things good for users. Then they might shift to prioritizing business customers, the ones who are actually giving them money, like the advertisers who are buying all that user data for ad slots. Then they'll go one step further, which is to prioritize short-term value for shareholders, which often means doing things that are actively hostile to both the end users and the businesses. They can get away with it because most of these platforms are very closed with a strong network effect and high switching costs. You can't just leave Facebook and take all your contacts with you. That is on purpose; Facebook designed it that way. So you stay, even if you can consciously say that you think it is doing you more harm than good. Doctorow's original meaning for it was a little more precise to this platform decay process, but as language often does, it has since taken on a life of its own to be more generally any time a company decides to screw over their customers to make a little more profit.\n\nI could talk more about how to resist this in terms of technology design, using the work of Doctorow and others, but for the sake of this sermon, I'm going to simply note that this is a modern version of the scarcity mindset much like we saw with Pharaoh. Even when we are talking about companies with market cap valuations in the trillions of dollars and maybe a couple hundred billion on the balance sheet, they will still try to squeeze in one more ad, or charge a couple percent more in fees, in order to always get a little bit more and it will always be at the expense of everybody else. They are in this same cycle, constantly demanding more and more power. They never see it as enough. All they can do is keep going, making it worse and worse.\n\n### Consumerism\n\nThe flip side of the demand to always be more productive is that even when we rest, it should be primarily spent consuming instead. Marlene's work in the previous message about rest did not make this idea less necessary to include, as she discussed how rest really means relationships, not just sitting on a couch.\n\nIf you do take that break, we hear the message that you better at least be using it to consume the production of others. A lot of what our culture now considers rest are things like watching TV. I like TV. I think there's a lot of good things that happen in that medium of storytelling. But sometimes it feels like it's just another chore, trying to keep up with the infinite supply of streaming services, and a lot of the time it might be a nice break but it's usually not any kind of reclaiming my humanity.\n\n### Heschel\n\nThis was a quote from the very first page of Heschel's work on the Sabbath that I found incredible, but it was too long to try to quote it all:\n\n> Technical civilization is man's conquest of space. It is a triumph frequently achieved by sacrificing an essential ingredient of existence, namely, time. In technical civilization, we expend time to gain space. To enhance our power in the world of space is our main objective. Yet to have more does not mean to be more. The power we attain in the world of space terminates abruptly at the borderline of time. But time is the heart of existence.\n>\n> To gain control of the world of space is certainly one of our tasks. The danger begins when in gaining power in the realm of space we forfeit all aspirations in the realm of time. There is a realm of time where the goal is not to have but to be, not to own but to give, not to control but to share, not to subdue but to be in accord. Life goes wrong when the control of space, the acquisition of things of space, becomes our sole concern.\"\n>\n> Nothing is more useful than power, nothing more frightful. We have often suffered from degradation by poverty, now we are threatened with degradation through power. There is happiness in the love of labor, there is misery in the love of gain. Many hearts and pitchers are broken at the fountain of profit. Selling himself into slavery to things, man becomes a utensil that is broken at the fountain.\"\n\n### Responsibility and Rest\n\nI was briefly going to spend more time tackling how the words of Jesus in Matthew 6 can be abused. That included dismissing mental health concerns – clinical anxiety is not the same thing as being stuck in the destructive scarcity loop - but also included a note on maintaining a sense of responsibility.\n\nThe words of Jesus are not about denying responsibility to care for yourself and others in the ways that you can. I think Abraham Joshua Heschel in his classic work on The Sabbath expresses some of this tension well and was along the same lines as Jesus in Matthew 6.\n\n> Our intention here is not to deprecate the world of space. To disparage space and the blessing of things of space, is to disparage the works of creation, the works which God beheld and saw \"it was good.\"… What we plead against is man's unconditional surrender to space, his enslavement to things. We must not forget that it is not a thing that lends significance to a moment; it is a moment that lends significance to things.\n","date":"2026-01-25T10:30:00.000Z"}},"docInfo":{"/2015/we-need-confession/":{"title":2,"tags":2,"description":4,"content":403},"/2015/review-searching-for-sunday/":{"title":3,"tags":3,"description":9,"content":284},"/2015/review-christian-hope-through-fulfilled-prophecy/":{"title":6,"tags":3,"description":6,"content":584},"/2015/anno-domini-or-common-era/":{"title":4,"tags":2,"description":5,"content":283},"/2015/approaching-apologetics/":{"title":2,"tags":1,"description":6,"content":460},"/2015/game-of-thrones-season-5/":{"title":4,"tags":5,"description":15,"content":502},"/2015/the-rise-of-the-empire/":{"title":2,"tags":4,"description":8,"content":581},"/2015/bringing-balance-to-the-force/":{"title":3,"tags":4,"description":10,"content":506},"/2016/allegiance-to-a-label/":{"title":2,"tags":3,"description":4,"content":380},"/2016/life-after-jesus/":{"title":3,"tags":1,"description":4,"content":1478},"/2016/sin-sunday/":{"title":3,"tags":1,"description":5,"content":1357},"/2016/atonement-god-jd-myers/":{"title":4,"tags":2,"description":6,"content":567},"/2017/rebellions-hope/":{"title":3,"tags":4,"description":4,"content":310},"/2017/swallowing-camel/":{"title":3,"tags":1,"description":6,"content":1087},"/2018/image-invisible-god/":{"title":4,"tags":2,"description":4,"content":1544},"/2018/beautiful-useful-mess/":{"title":4,"tags":3,"description":4,"content":1551},"/2019/jesus-break-wheel/":{"title":3,"tags":3,"description":5,"content":1394},"/2020/magnificat-hope/":{"title":2,"tags":3,"description":5,"content":1079},"/2021/many-tongues/":{"title":3,"tags":3,"description":4,"content":1044},"/2022/way-leaf/":{"title":2,"tags":2,"description":10,"content":1416},"/2023/appetizer-way/":{"title":2,"tags":5,"description":14,"content":2093},"/2024/new-blog/":{"title":2,"tags":1,"description":11,"content":104},"/2024/cult-innocence/":{"title":2,"tags":2,"description":10,"content":1880},"/2024/recycling-christianity/":{"title":2,"tags":4,"description":9,"content":3536},"/2024/remembrance-day/":{"title":3,"tags":2,"description":7,"content":185},"/2024/ambs-challenging-christian-nationalism/":{"title":4,"tags":2,"description":12,"content":35},"/2024/echo-chambers/":{"title":2,"tags":3,"description":10,"content":622},"/2024/distractions/":{"title":2,"tags":2,"description":8,"content":377},"/2024/hope-sewer-rat/":{"title":3,"tags":1,"description":5,"content":121},"/2024/preaching/":{"title":1,"tags":2,"description":9,"content":640},"/2024/shiphrah-puah-moses/":{"title":3,"tags":2,"description":12,"content":215},"/2025/empathetic-imagination/":{"title":2,"tags":3,"description":9,"content":555},"/2025/theological-background/":{"title":3,"tags":2,"description":8,"content":329},"/2025/lectionary-jan26/":{"title":5,"tags":1,"description":6,"content":392},"/2025/lectionary-feb-2/":{"title":5,"tags":1,"description":8,"content":463},"/2025/lectionary-feb9/":{"title":5,"tags":1,"description":8,"content":302},"/2025/lectionary-feb16/":{"title":5,"tags":1,"description":6,"content":426},"/2025/kingdom-planet-apes/":{"title":5,"tags":4,"description":10,"content":513},"/2025/lectionary-feb23/":{"title":5,"tags":1,"description":6,"content":647},"/2025/lectionary-mar2/":{"title":5,"tags":1,"description":10,"content":326},"/2025/whose-armour/":{"title":2,"tags":3,"description":8,"content":1339},"/2025/summer-lars-real-girl/":{"title":6,"tags":5,"description":8,"content":825},"/2025/meanings-sabbath/":{"title":2,"tags":2,"description":12,"content":1000},"/2025/manger-misunderstanding/":{"title":5,"tags":4,"description":9,"content":2162},"/2026/sabbath-resistance/":{"title":5,"tags":2,"description":8,"content":2393}},"length":45,"save":true},"index":{"title":{"root":{"1":{"6":{"docs":{"/2025/lectionary-feb16/":{"tf":1}},"df":1},"docs":{},"df":0},"2":{"0":{"2":{"5":{"docs":{"/2025/lectionary-jan26/":{"tf":1},"/2025/lectionary-feb-2/":{"tf":1},"/2025/lectionary-feb9/":{"tf":1},"/2025/lectionary-feb16/":{"tf":1},"/2025/lectionary-feb23/":{"tf":1},"/2025/lectionary-mar2/":{"tf":1}},"df":6},"docs":{},"df":0},"docs":{},"df":0},"3":{"docs":{"/2025/lectionary-feb23/":{"tf":1}},"df":1},"6":{"docs":{"/2025/lectionary-jan26/":{"tf":1}},"df":1},"docs":{"/2025/lectionary-feb-2/":{"tf":1},"/2025/lectionary-mar2/":{"tf":1}},"df":2},"5":{"docs":{"/2015/game-of-thrones-season-5/":{"tf":1}},"df":1},"9":{"docs":{"/2025/lectionary-feb9/":{"tf":1}},"df":1},"docs":{},"df":0,"n":{"docs":{},"df":0,"e":{"docs":{},"df":0,"e":{"docs":{},"df":0,"d":{"docs":{"/2015/we-need-confession/":{"tf":1}},"df":1}},"w":{"docs":{"/2024/new-blog/":{"tf":1}},"df":1}},"a":{"docs":{},"df":0,"t":{"docs":{},"df":0,"i":{"docs":{},"df":0,"o":{"docs":{},"df":0,"n":{"docs":{"/2024/ambs-challenging-christian-nationalism/":{"tf":1}},"df":1}}}},"r":{"docs":{},"df":0,"r":{"docs":{"/2025/manger-misunderstanding/":{"tf":1}},"df":1}}},"o":{"docs":{},"df":0,"t":{"docs":{},"df":0,"e":{"docs":{"/2025/lectionary-jan26/":{"tf":1},"/2025/lectionary-feb-2/":{"tf":1},"/2025/lectionary-feb9/":{
