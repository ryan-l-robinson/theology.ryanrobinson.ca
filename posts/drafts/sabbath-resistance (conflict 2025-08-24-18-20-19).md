I have often heard a sentiment that goes like: it is important to rest so that you are ready to keep doing things as effectively as possible. If you don't rest because you're pursuing all the things you "need" to be doing, you'll wear out and end up getting a lot less down, so it's actually counterproductive. That's completely true, and it's a way of framing it that might get through to some trapped in the productivity mindset so I am not rejecting it.

But I've also become convinced that rest in itself is an act of resistance against a world that demands constant production, that declares that we are worth less when we aren't producing. Choosing to simply be human and be content with that, especially in the presence of other humans, is an essential tool in reminding ourselves that we are not defined by our productivity or our consumption.

Even when we are allowed to stop producing for a moment, we are expected to use that to time to consume the production of others instead. I have a constant watchlist of TV and movies, and a constant backlog of videogames. I like a lot of that TV and those movies and truly value the storytelling power of some of them. But it does feel like it's just another chore of being a good cultural consumer sometimes. Much of the time, consuming that media is relaxing - especially the videogames that I find to be a great balance of engaged without straining. But is it restful? I'm not sure that's the same thing.

Some have identified different types of rest. I find this valuable. The one I feel most acutely is sensory rest. Sometimes I don't need to sleep, but I do need to simply lie down in a quiet dark room. I need some time where my brain is not processing a podcast or an audiobook or a TV show or that chore or that project that I'm working on. I need to just be.

My favourite thing in the summer is the festival season in my region. Many weekends there is some festival. I rarely care about the reason for the festival. There's one with classic cars. I do not care about classic cars. But it can be one of my favourite things to simply walk outside with a bunch of other relaxed people while other people show off the work of their hobby.

Sermon in the back of my mind going full circle about Sabbath: it's not God selfishly demanding worship as often said, some parts of Scripture suggest it's about resisting temptations of Empire, so maybe you really should go to worship once a week to remind yourself of that different way of being.
