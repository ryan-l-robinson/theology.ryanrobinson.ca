One of my all-time favourite shows is The Good Place and we recently decided to watch through it again. Since this is a show all about philosophy and community and theology (without much of an explicit God figure), it's pretty great for a discussion start point.

For the first post inspired by this rewatch, I'm fascinated by the way that the point system is represented in the first episode. Including its jokes, but my version will be much less funny.

Michael explains that over the course of your life, every action you take is given a point value, either positive or negative. Those above a certain point score at the end of their life go to The Good Place. Everyone else goes to The Bad Place. It's a perfectly fair system, right?
