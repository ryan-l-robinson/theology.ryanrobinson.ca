Eleanor quickly realizes that she does not belong in the Good Place. She then finds Jason who also realizes he doesn't belong.

At the end of the first season, we learn that Chidi and Tahani also don't belong, but they had never considered it.

This makes for a very interesting contrast with shame on one side and pride on the other, but thing back to the first post about the idea of sin, I think they're really two sides of the same coin. Both are based in the concept of judging yourself against some criteria. You come out the other side as either one of the bad ones (shame) or one of the good ones (pride).

But what if that initial question is the wrong one? What if our worth, our belonging, our beloved was, isn't determined by how we stack up in the cosmic points system?
