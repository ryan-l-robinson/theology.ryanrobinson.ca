[T](http://www.anabaptistredux.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Final-Paper-Factors-Leading-to-the-Emerging-Church-Movement.pdf)his paper was initially written for the course Reformation and Revival in Winter 2012.

The term “the emerging church” is one that is used more and more frequently within contemporary discussion. At the same time, it is a movement that it is still challenging to define and challenging to see how it fits within the scope of history. However, the emerging church is not a surprising movement in the church’s history. Within the grand scheme of church history, the current movement is actually quite expected (at least in hindsight). Furthermore, the current movement is caused largely by opposition to – or at least a call to move beyond - previous actions of the church and of society as a whole, particularly evangelical conservatism and modernist philosophy.<!--more-->

### The Emerging Church within History

To understand the big picture of Christian history, two different and complementary theories of the grand scheme of Christian history can be used. Phyllis Tickle speaks of 500-year cycles, where approximately every 500 years there is a major “rummage sale” in society as a whole as well as in the church. In the 16th century, there was the Great Reformation along with several cultural changes such as the rise of the nation state, the corruptions of the Catholic Church, the invention of the printing press, and the early stages of humanism and modernism. Moving back 500 years, in the 11th century was the Great Schism between the Western Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. In the 6th century, the fall of the Roman Empire led to the work of Gregory the Great, redefining Christianity largely in monastic terms for the post-Roman medieval world. In the 1st century, there obviously was the “Great Transformation”: the incarnation of Jesus and the beginning of the church. It is possible to even go back farther, although not quite sticking to an even 5 centuries, to include the Babylonian Exile in the 6th century BCE and the time of David and Solomon (assuming they are historical figures) in the 10th or 11th century BCE.\[1\]

Rather than speak of cycles, Brian McLaren – often pinpointed as one of the foremost leaders of the emerging church - speaks of a steady evolution. Even though he refers to “a new kind of Christianity,” he says that it “is not simply new – in a sense of a new tree being planted at some distance from an old one. It is, rather, the green tips grown out on many of the fragile branches of the ancient tree of faith and spirituality that has been growing through history.”\[2\] The emerging church, then, as with societal change in general, is not a new detached movement – it is more of a re-envisioning of faith throughout history.\[3\] These stages of spiritual development, framed in terms of what we are “questing” for, occur both individually and corporately, but as a general trend slowly improve over time as we quest (in order) for survival, security, power, independence, individuality, honesty, and ubuntu (roughly translated “community”, “unity”, or “oneness with diversity”). In the contemporary Western world, we primarily see religion as an answer to one or more of the last four, although the motivation of the first three is still strong. Modernism largely brought the quests for independence and individuality, while post-modernism has brought with it the quests for honesty and more recently ubuntu. While McLaren clearly sees the later stages as better, he also emphasizes that he does not blame those in prior zones who are not mature enough to accept the quest for ubuntu and he even puts himself primarily in the quest for honesty. \[4\]

If both theories are combined, we have the idea of a cycle in church history with peaks and troughs, but with a steady upward climb because the peaks ultimately overcome the troughs. Common to both theories there is an idea that there is always motivation to move to the next level or the next stage of the cycle. In other words, both theories agree that reform movements come out of a social and religious context. This becomes very valuable in any attempt to define the emerging church.

### The Emerging Church Conversation

Defining the emerging church is always a challenge. One of the most common definitions given, particularly by those within the emerging church, is that it is a “conversation.”\[5\] This is in line with McLaren’s “quest for ubuntu” definition where the priority is now peaceful unity through celebrating diversity. Specifically, the movement has been described as an ecumenical conversation, a movement building outward from the centre of the four quadrants of Christianity: Liturgicals, Social Justice Christians, Conservatives, and Renewalists.\[6\] Above anything else the movement can be best described in these terms, at least in this early stage. It is a desire to change the church for the better, and to do so through communal, ecumenical means.

This definition is not one that is accepted by all, particularly because it is typically only those who are emerging from the Conservative quadrant of Christianity that explicitly refer to themselves as “emerging church.”\[7\] This is the primary reason why defining the emerging church is so challenging: if by emerging church it is meant all those who call themselves emerging, then it is probably valid to restrict the emerging church to being a primarily Conservative-quadrant movement. If, like with Phyllis Tickle’s definition, the emerging church is a larger phenomenon as a result of an emerging shift in culture, then this includes those in the Liturgical, Social Justice, and Renewalist quadrants as well. There is yet to be a consensus on this definition, but for the sake of this paper, the larger definition is assumed while also acknowledging that the majority of explicitly “emerging church” writings are from the Conservative quadrant.

For a clear example of confusion, one could look at two cases of new churches each named Mars Hill. Mark Driscoll of Mars Hill Church (Seattle) has previously identified himself as “emerging,” and his young-adult-oriented missional attitude is in line with much of what the rest of the emerging church practices. However, theologically he is very modernist and very conservative in his thinking, with sermons that claim strict facts and ethical rules. He would accept and fiercely defend as absolutely necessary beliefs each of the five points deemed as “fundamentals.”\[8\] Driscoll highly values Reformed orthodoxy and does not shy away from calling out what he deems heresies, which in some cases is simply another Christian tradition. On the other hand, Rob Bell of Mars Hill Church (Michigan) has outright denied the label “emerging” but is frequently referred to as such. Bell’s sermons are primarily narrative and he takes a more gentle approach to many ethical issues. He is quick to engage with other Christian traditions, even though he also refers to himself as an evangelical, and is rarely if ever heard completely rejecting another Christian’s input as wrong or heretical. If we strictly call those emerging who call themselves emerging, Driscoll was (but isn’t anymore), but Bell is not. However, following Tickle’s framework, Driscoll is much more likely to be categorized as a Conservative reactionary while Bell likely would be considered an emerging or at least a Progressive or a Hyphenated (the stances in-between emerging and reactionary, closest to the emerging position).\[9\]  This example goes to show that this definition is a confusing one to settle on.

Using the working definition above, if the emerging church is a conversation, it must be a conversation about something. By definition of the name, the emerging church is often explained by what it is emerging from, in terms of a protest: protest against the existing church and protest against the existing culture as a whole.\[10\] Books from the emerging movement unashamedly bare titles like _They Like Jesus But Not the Church_ **\[11\]** and _A New Kind of Christianity.**\[12\]**_ It is not strictly opposed to recent Christian faith in its entirety; as mentioned earlier with McLaren, it is more often seen as a revitalizing or correcting of some aspects within an otherwise-correct faith. Similarly, the emerging church is not opposed to culture as a whole, but specifically the emerging church like culture as a whole has rejected modernism in favour of postmodernism.

### The Protest against the (Conservative) Church

Many critics of the emerging church rightfully point out that its leaders are often those who have had negative experiences with churches from the Conservative quadrant, usually those bordering on (or those proudly being) fundamentalist. The majority of those explicitly calling themselves “emerging” do indeed fall in this category, but their critiques typically apply not just to the extremes and in many cases do apply even to segments of the church other than the Conservative quadrant. These critiques call for a church that is not the same as the church has been. If the church has been seen as too political, then some segments of the emerging church is apolitical, or if the church has been seen as too heavily emphasizing orthodoxy, then some sections of the emerging church have been centred on orthopraxy. Emerging Christians are typically very interested in how they are seen by the rest of the world – and thus how they are fulfilling their mission to be different than the world – and typically echo many of the complaints of the church that their non-Christian friends do.\[13\]

This comes out particularly strongly in the realm of biblical interpretation. For example, Mark Driscoll (mentioned previously), defines himself as a Biblicist and describes his source of authority this way:

> How Does God Speak? Scripture.
> 
> No one is born with a clear comprehension of who God is. So, in an effort to know about God, various philosophers and religious leaders have presented their speculations about God with seemingly endless and contradictory declarations.
> 
> But God has chosen to lift the fog of human speculation with divine revelation. Whereas speculation is the human attempt to comprehend God, revelation is God’s communication to humanity with clarity that is otherwise impossible. The object of that revelation is the sixty-six books of Scripture.\[14\]

Driscoll does later say that this “does not dismiss lower courts of authority such as experience, tradition, or archaeology” but all of those things are to be brought into line with Scripture “without modification.”\[15\]

To put it in other words, evangelicalism is a very broad category and its diversity is often seen as a problem by those conservative evangelicals such as Driscoll, D.A. Carson, and David Wells. Orthodoxy is highly valued – “Christian orthodoxy ought to be part of its \[evangelicalism’s\] very definition and that orthodoxy should be fairly detailed”\[16\] – which means no deviation from traditional interpretations of Scripture used to reach traditional systematic theologies. The whole concept of _A Generous Orthodoxy,**\[17\]**_ one of the book titles of emerging leader Brian McLaren, would be a contradiction in terms: orthodoxy is not generous for conservative evangelicals. It can be said that “Carson probably speaks for most, if not all, conservative evangelicals when he complains that in the pluralism of the evangelical movement the traditional theological content of evangelicalism is being reduced to a vanishing point.”\[18\]

This is a view of Scripture that is different from many who call themselves the emerging church, and flatly opposes the postmodernist and ecumenical conversation that underlies so much of the emerging church. In fact, Driscoll has frequently ended up on the opposite end of hot-topic debates to others such as Rob Bell and Paul Young with differing Scriptural interpretations as the key difference.\[19\] Both sides claim the Bible as an authority and even in most cases as the primary authority, but there are vastly different interpretative methods. This difference can be defined this way: emergings tend to be more interested in the actual truth of the Bible than the factual truth.\[20\]

Emergings, of whom post-conservative evangelicals can be considered a subset, continue to value orthodoxy. At the same time, they do not see it as “a closed book or a set of commandments written in stone; orthodoxy is not revelation itself” but rather as “the product of human reflection on God’s revelation and therefore is open to reconsideration in light of faithful and fresh readings of God’s Word.”\[21\] The conflict may be summarized this way:

> On the one hand, conservative evangelicals admit _sola scriptura_ – that Scripture alone stands as the final source and norm of theology so that every doctrinal formulation, however ancient and accepted, is subject to correction by Scripture. On the other hand, they label as less than fully or authentically evangelical any theologians or theological proposals that diverge from manmade orthodoxy. How then can an evangelical theologian subject ancient and accepted doctrines to critical scrutiny and propose revisions in the light of faithful and fresh biblical understanding without automatically being condemned as nonevangelical?\[22\]

In many ways, then, post-conservative emergings are simply trying to hold conservatives to the theology of authority that they theoretically accept. When this gets put into practice, however, many specific issues will be disagreed over, with conservatives claiming that post-conservatives are not respecting Scripture and post-conservatives accusing conservatives of holding their traditional interpretation above Scripture itself.

This constitutional viewing of the Bible – where the Bible is a textbook for scientific, historical, and moral facts to be used to support your theology – is routinely rejected in place of a broader narrative perspective.\[23\] Brian McLaren says that he is “happy and honored to consider \[him\]self an evangelical” and then goes on to differentiate between Evangelical (a segment of the church usually associated with conservatism) and evangelical (“an attitude toward God and our neighbor and our mission that is passionate” which is “surprisingly liberal”). \[24\] McLaren also explains why he, like most emergings, considers himself to have a “regard for the Bible... higher than ever.”\[25\] He then spares no harsh words for the way that he was taught to understand the Bible when he was younger in a conservative evangelical church:

> True, I grew up being taught that the Bible was an answer book, supplying exactly the kind of information modern, Western, moderately educated people want from a phone book, encyclopedia, or legal constitution. We want to know exactly when the earth was created (4004 BC or thereabouts) and how (instantaneously, during six 24-hour periods), along with when it will end…
> 
> We wanted a simple, clear, efficient, and convenient plan for getting to heaven after death. Between then and now, we wanted clear assurance that God didn’t like the people we didn’t like, and for the same reasons we didn’t like them. Finally, we wanted a rule book that made it objectively clear, with no subjective ambiguity, what behaviors were right and wrong for all time, in all places, and among all cultures, especially if those rules confirmed our views and not those of people we considered “liberal.”\[26\]

In place of this textbook-Bible, described with words like “_authority, inerrancy, infallibility, revelation, objective, absolute,_ and _literal,_”\[27\] the Bible is described primarily using words that it uses of itself: “useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.”\[28\]

Instead of looking at the Bible for the fine details, emergings tend to suggest looking at the grand scope of the Scriptural story. In place of analytical, facts-based Bible study mining for historical facts, McLaren suggests these different ways of looking at the Bible:

> - Become students, seekers, learners.
> - Admit that parts of the Bible perplex, bother, confuse or concern you.
> - Broaden your preoccupation with propositions (what you are supposed to think) so it includes mission (what you are supposed to be and do)
> - Drop any affair you may have with certainty, proof, argument – and replace it with dialogue, conversation, intrigue, and search.
> - Drop any analytical-reductionist tendencies and instead focus on the big story, always moving toward your place in its ongoing trajectory.
> - Find things to do with the Bible other than read and study it.
> - Don’t try to solve mysteries – seek and revere them.
> - Value marginalized readings and readers.
> - Think of the Bible as a book of answers and questions.
> - If you preach, preach differently.\[29\]

Scot McKnight draws a similar contrast between ways that the Bible has been read in conservative evangelical Christianity in the recent past and the ways that emerging Christians read the Bible. As an emerging, he suggests something that is much closer to a Jewish understanding:

> We have the text, the Bible itself; we have “our plot” that ties the Bible together so that we can comprehend the text; and we have the Story that God is telling, which the Scripture itself also tells but never completely…
> 
> The ultimate truth is “the Story”.
> 
> The written truth is made up of “wiki-stories.”
> 
> The oral truth, our interpretation of the wiki-stories, our plots of the wiki-stories, is “church tradition.”\[30\]

In summary, then, this is the heart of the authority question being challenged by the emerging church. The source of authority is largely unchanged, with the Bible as central. Yet the Bible is primarily about the story, not the historical or scientific or even moral or theological details. Those details can sometimes still be drawn out but they are secondary to the Story which engulfs the life of the reader.

### The Protest against Modernism

Up to now, this paper has shown that the emerging church is primarily a protest movement against the way that the church had been and in many cases still is. From here, the obvious question is why this protest movement has arisen now. For this, many identify the emerging church movement as synonymous with a post-modern church movement. Many in the emerging church saw modernism as dangerous or at least incomplete, but now see post-modernism as good news.\[31\] However, post-modernism, like emerging church and evangelical, are hard to define. When many hear the term postmodern, they assume a hard postmodernism which essentially means that there is no such thing as ultimate truth because all is relative. Modernist Christians will often brand as heretics anybody who claims postmodernism because they are assuming this meaning of postmodern. There is a softer version of postmodernism, however, which:

> does not deny ontological reality or objective truth but seeks to show that even reason always operates within a narrative context. In other words, knowledge may be relative but truth is not… This is not relativism but recognition of the relativity of perspective inherent in all human thinking. All reasoning and judging takes place from within some local context shaped by a narrative about reality and carried forward within a community of tradition created by that narrative.\[32\]

This latter position, soft postmodernism, is by far the most common view amongst the emerging church. For example, one of the tough issues of contemporary theology is the place for other religions. Modernists are more inclined to be exclusivist: there is one God reached through explicitly claiming Jesus. Since Jesus is taught by the Christian religion, this is the same thing as saying that God is reached through Christianity. Postmodernists in the emerging church are more inclined to be inclusivists: they may agree with exclusivists that Jesus is the ultimate revelation of God (“the Way, the Truth, and the Life”\[33\]), but do not equate that to saying that Jesus/God can only be experienced within Christianity, leaving open options to experience varying degrees of that objective truth through various means.\[34\] For added comparison, hard postmodernists would be most likely to be relativistic universalists: since there is no objective reality, there is no way to consider one religion any more accurate than any other.

The issue at hand is one of epistemology: how humans know things. This is quite clearly of large significance to the previous discussion on how to understand the Bible, which then shapes many other theological questions. While modernism taught that there was one truth to all questions, and that with the proper objective research we can discover it, post-modernism has exploded that presupposition. As the church largely followed the world into modernism, so the church is largely following the world into post-modernism. It is no coincidence the first full postmodern generation is also the same generation in which the emerging church has mostly come into being.

Although different datings could be given, the age of modernism began at least close to the same time as the last great shake-up of the church, the Reformation. The church for the most part operated on modern principles, too. Protestantism embraced deductive authority through inerrant Scripture, and Catholicism embraced an infallible papacy; both had a perfect, objective authority. Over time, this began to crumble. Liberal Protestantism through scholarly biblical study began to find problems with literal interpretation of Scripture. In response, fundamentalists reinforced the ultimate authority of a literal reading of Scripture, rejecting any other source of authority. The Pentecostal movement has also undoubtedly had a big part to play in this as well, as well as liberation theology and some other movements with different sources of authority. By allowing more room for the acting of the Holy Spirit directly into peoples’ lives or for experience, it became a lot harder to strictly stick to only one source of authority. Many of the “failings” of the modern church have been discussed in the previous section and these also contribute to this idea of multiple viewpoints on truth.

Outside of the church, society has undergone more changes in the past 100 years than any other century in history by far. As the printing press was a major factor in allowing the Great Reformation, technologies of radio, television and most powerfully the Internet have allowed for the development of postmodernism. No longer do Christians need to receive their spiritual instruction as well as other information from simply church and school – they can find what they are looking for within minutes using media. Family structures have changed, with the home becoming more of a place for each member to go after work rather than work being the place the father of the house goes to provide for his family. Scientific advances have also shattered many assumptions of authority, most notably Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle which can be described as the scientific version of philosophy’s postmodernism. Discussing Einstein’s response to Heisenberg’s principle, Phyllis Tickle says this of the consequences:

> Einstein saw Heisenberg’s Uncertainty as a corruption, and even a reprehensible misuse, of his special theory of relativity, arguing that it destroyed the basis for any “fact” in life. Einstein was right in his interpretation of the consequences, but Heisenberg was right in his science. Nor would the Heisenberg Principle stay safely tucked away in physics labs. Instead, “uncertainty” became the only fact that could be accepted as fat, not only in the popular mind, but also in large segments of the academic mind as well.\[35\]

After many changes that have occurred since the Great Reformation and the dawn of modernism, as a society we have now shifted to postmodernist understandings of truth, and there is no denying that this has affected the church in powerful ways. Now it is fair to say that the emerging church is synonymous with the (soft) postmodernist church.

### Conclusion

The emerging church is not likely to go anywhere any time soon even if the label does fade away. It is part of a much wider culture shift, so realistically the emerging church soft postmodern paradigm will be around as long as postmodernism is – which if some prior cycles of history stay true will be approximately 500 years.  This is a movement primarily of protest against authorities: the church’s authority particularly on biblical interpretation and any denominational authority over and against other denominations. Behind the surface protest of the church, though, is a deeper cultural shift from a modernist epistemology to a postmodernist.

## Figure 1

This diagram represents Phyllis Tickle’s categories of the current state of the church (not to scale). First, she explains the four quadrants. The vertical line primarily represents where authority is found: those on the right are motivated by Scripture while those on the right are motivated primarily by the church, experience, or the Holy Spirit. The horizontal line represents an emphasis on orthodoxy (below) vs orthopraxy (above).

In the centre, as a sometimes messy line of conversation between the four quadrants, is the emerging church. On the extreme ends are reactionaries who entrench their prior beliefs even stronger than previously in response to the challenges from the centre. In between are four levels of desire for reform, from the outside in being: Traditionalists, Re-Traditionalists, Progressives, and Hyphenateds.
