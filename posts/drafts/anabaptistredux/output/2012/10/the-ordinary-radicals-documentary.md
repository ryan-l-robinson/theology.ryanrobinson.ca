I stumbled across a documentary effort recently called [The Ordinary Radicals](http://jamiemoffett.com/films/ "The Ordinary Radicals"). The phrase is one that you are particularly likely to encounter with the work of Shane Claiborne. I've yet to buy the whole movie but it looks like it is definitely an interesting one. I'll probably pick it up soon, but in the meantime, check out the trailer embedded below.
