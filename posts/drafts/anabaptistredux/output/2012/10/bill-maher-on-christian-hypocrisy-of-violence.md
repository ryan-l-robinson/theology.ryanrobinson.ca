This is a brilliant bit from Bill Maher, who routinely makes jokes at the expense of Christians, was laying on some more in this one, but with a very good serious point underlying it. After some great laughter over the previous "New Rules" he suggests in this segment, he says that you can't call yourself a Christian if you're also pro-torture and the audience goes silent for a few seconds before a couple of people applaud.  It's actually a great commentary with some good humour interspersed. Warning: offensive language.

My favourite line:

> Jesus lays on that hippie stuff pretty thick. He has lines like “Do not repay evil with evil” and “Do not take revenge on someone who wrongs you.” Really! It’s in that book you hold up when you scream at gay people.

But on the deeper point, he provides a surprisingly great analysis of the problem of hypocrisy when so-called Christians are also the ones calling for bombings of enemy countries, or torturing prisoners of war, or any other kind of violence.
