Today kicked off Advent, the season when we start thinking about all the Christmas shopping we need to do. Oh wait, it's supposed to be about something more than that, isn't it? Christmas is about remembering the incarnation, a central doctrine in Christian theology. This incarnation was of a God with infinite power choosing to give that all up because there are more important things, like giving himself up for those he loves. I've written on this before in one of my earliest posts on this site, entitled A Subversive Christmas. For another way to look at it, a way that is easier for you to spread the idea around perhaps, watch the video from Advent Conspiracy below. Think about it. Follow through with what it is suggesting. And encourage others to do the same. Let's redeem this season of consumerism by subverting it back to being a season for the Kingdom of God.
