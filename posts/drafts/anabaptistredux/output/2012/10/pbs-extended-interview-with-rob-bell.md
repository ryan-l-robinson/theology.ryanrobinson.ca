People seem to never get tied of the controversy around Rob Bell, although it definitely isn't as bitter in the Christian blogosphere as it was a couple of months ago.  Regardless, just came across this interview of Bell on PBS talking about a lot of the things that got him in trouble with his book Love Wins.  Check it out (especially if you haven't read the book) and leave some comments of what you think.
