I first heard of this documentary a few years ago, during the height of the Iraq War, but never remembered to actually track it down to watch it. Turns out it is available for free on the Internet so wasn't all that hard to track down. In the course of making this movie, the filmmaker talks to 3 of my favourite Christian teachers: Bruxy Cavey, Brian McLaren, and Tony Campolo. He also talks to some on the other side of the debate, and does a pretty good job of presenting both sides well even though he admits that after talking to Just War theorists he became a hardcore pacifist. I'll spare any more commentary for now because I've covered a lot of it at various points before, but watch the video for a nice summary of the debate.
