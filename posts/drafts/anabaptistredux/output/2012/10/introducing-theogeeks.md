I'm happy to announce my involvement in a new theological forum. Last week a few people who have no "real-life" connection but had met through theological discussion, myself included, decided to launch a new page for centralizing these discussions and making them available to more people. We've dubbed it "Theogeeks," an appropriate name for the type of discussions we're going for. Here's the information from our About page as it stands right now (undergoing some more edits, probably):

> ### What is this page all about?
> 
> A place to ask questions and discuss Christian theology respectfully. Though all are welcome, this page is intended for believers and seekers and not as a forum for debate among theist and atheists.
> 
> <!--more-->
> 
> ### What kind of posts are there on Theogeeks?
> 
> There are several different kinds of posts on Theogeeks.
> 
> **Discussion :** this is a post that is designed for theological discussion. These will be the primary number of posts on Theogeeks. These posts will often be followed by many comments of people discussing the finer theological points that have been raised.
> 
> **Articles :** These are posts that point to theological thought. These are normally blogs, or academic articles. There will normally be a brief outline of the contents of the article to aid you in whether or not the article may be for you.
> 
> **News :** these posts inform the Theogeek community of news items that affect theology.
> 
> ### How do I get my post on Theogeeks?
> 
> Theogeeks is an ongoing discussion. We are always on the look out for new ideas to debate, contemplate, and consider, and new approaches to theology, always keeping Christ at the center.
> 
> Your post could lead the next Theogeeks discussion! If you think you have found something that Theogeeks would be interested in, then please follow these (hopefully simple) guidelines.
> 
> **1\. If you are looking for discussion around your own theological thought.** \- Please make present the entirety of your post on G+. While we appreciate that many people have succesful blogs, in order to enable discussion on G+ it is necessary to have the text in the post so that it can be shared on Theogeeks. This does not mean, of course, that you cannot have a link to your blog in the post.
> 
> **2\. If you are looking to discuss someone else's theological thought.** - Please ensure that you clarify enough of it in your post as possible, using italics to show where you have quoted verbatim from the site in question. Remember to always be respectful of someone else's theological thought, even if you do not agree with it. Please also remember to include a link to the original source or provide a full citation of the book from which it comes.
> 
> **3\. If you are looking to bring an article, or item of news to the attention of Theogeeks.** - Please remember to only use reputable sources. While there will no-doubt be much divided opinion over what counts as a reputable source, places like the BBC, Reuters, Al-Jazeera, and so on will beat tabloid news papers (and their related websites), tabloid news papers will beat a personal blog, and so on and so fourth. Please give a brief description of the content of the article to help others know if the article will be for them.
> 
> 4. **Once you have selected the type of post** , you simply need to mark it by tagging +Theogeeks, or by using the #theogeeks hashtag. A friendly staff member will check often to see if there are articles, posts, or discussion that should be posted on the main page. Posts will be selected and re-shared by +Theogeeks based on merit. There is no theological leaning to Theogeeks, so all posts from all traditions and directions are welcome. We value well written, well researched, and well cited posts. We also value posts that are relevant to current events, get us thinking, or offer something new or different that might be of value to believers and seekers.
> 
> ### How do I receive up-to-date notifications?
> 
> If you would like to stay involved with this page by receiving notifications of new posts as they are published, simply address a post to +theogeeks letting us know you'd like to be added to the Notification Circle.
