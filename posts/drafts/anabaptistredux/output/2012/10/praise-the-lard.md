Time for a less-serious post. This was [an article from MSNBC about religious people being more likely to become obese](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/42256829/ns/health-diet_and_nutrition/ "Praise the lard? Study links church to obesity").

> “Our main finding was that people with a high frequency of religious participation in young adulthood were 50 percent more likely to become obese by middle age than those with no religious participation in young adulthood,” says Matthew Feinstein, the study’s lead investigator and a fourth-year medical student at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.

It also goes on to talk about the frequent potlucks of lots of salts and sugars. Reminds me of something a friend of mine said a couple of years ago soon after becoming a Christian: "I'm going to gain a lot of weight. Christians are always going out for dessert."

I'm always looking for theological themes, though, so I wonder if it has anything to do with a de-emphasizing of this body and this life. That isn't a theme in all churches, but it definitely is in a bunch of them, especially more evangelical ones (not intentionally, just as a consequence of so much afterlife emphasis). Any thoughts or is it just the potlucks?
