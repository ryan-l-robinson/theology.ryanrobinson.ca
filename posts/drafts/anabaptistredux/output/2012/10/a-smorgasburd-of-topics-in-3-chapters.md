I’ve had an idea stewing in my head for a while about a series of posts. It’s bound to be controversial, but I’ve decided to go ahead with it. Genesis 1-3, the creation account and “the fall,” is probably the most referenced section of the Bible by preacher and layperson alike. I don’t personally think that these texts should be elevated to such an influential status, but that’s the way it is so we may as well work with it. All kinds of topics are covered, too – probably even more than those I’ve listed below. In my next series of posts, which I will try to post one of each week, I’ll start to look at these different issues. The precise list might change with maybe some added and others dropped, but here's my starting point:

1. [The Trinity](http://anabaptistredux.com/the-trinity-in-the-creation-story/ "The Trinity in the Creation Story")
2. [The Formless and Void](http://anabaptistredux.com/tohu-va-bohu/ "Tohu va Bohu")
3. [The Nature of Humanity](http://anabaptistredux.com/humanity-the-image-bearers-of-god/ "Humanity, the Image-Bearers of God")
4. [Dominion Over the Earth](http://anabaptistredux.com/dominion-over-the-earth/ "Dominion Over the Earth")
5. [Methods of Creation](http://anabaptistredux.com/creationism-in-the-genesis-account/ "Creationism in the Genesis Account")
6. [The Sabbath](http://anabaptistredux.com/the-origins-of-the-sabbath/ "The Origins of the Sabbath")
7. [Marriage 1 - Not Good to be Alone](http://anabaptistredux.com/its-not-good-to-be-alone/ "It’s Not Good to Be Alone")
8. [Marriage 2 - Women as Helper](http://anabaptistredux.com/eve-adams-helpmeet/ "Eve, Adam’s Helpmeet")
9. [Marriage 3 - Adam and Steve](http://anabaptistredux.com/adam-and-steve/ "Adam and Steve")

11. Trouble In Paradise 1 - The Lie That Started It All
12. Trouble in Paradise 2 - Eve, the Typical Weak Woman
