Earlier today I was contacted by someone in the marketing department for [Logos Bible Software](https://www.logos.com/ "Logos Bible Software"). He wanted me to know, and to pass on to you the reader, that [they now have available for pre-order a collection of works of John Howard Yoder](https://www.logos.com/product/23960/john-howard-yoder-collection "John Howard Yoder Collection on Logos"). In case you're unfamiliar with Yoder, here's the description:

> John Howard Yoder (1927–1997), professor of theology and ethics, was widely respected for his work on Christian pacifism, ecclesiology, and ethics. After leading relief and revival efforts in Europe after World War II, Yoder began teaching at both Goshen Biblical Seminary and Mennonite Biblical Seminary, where his ideas on Christian pacifism made an indelible mark on his students. His influential works stirred up a whole new discourse in Christian political involvement.
> 
> <!--more-->This collection offers insight into Yoder’s thought, providing translations of the books that most deeply influenced his views on Christianity, pacifism, and war, as well as clear arguments for politically-active, peace-focused belief. Yoder’s own well-known titles, including What Would You Do? and A Declaration of Peace, reflect this eminent theologian’s stance on morality and ethics and open up the conversation for readers to explore.
> 
> Now, with this powerful 12-volume collection, you can study Yoder's works more closely than ever before. With Logos Bible Software, Yoder’s works are completely searchable, Scripture references, just a click away, link to your favorite translation and to the original-language texts, and every word ties in to the rest of your digital library, opening up Yoder’s thought like never before. Yoder’s challenging and life-changing messages, sure to enrich your Bible study, will be a valuable addition to your study of pacifism, the church, or ethics.

I personally haven't used Logos so can't say much about it. I'll probably keep holding out at least until they release a BlackBerry app, maybe longer than that because it can get pretty pricey. But I have heard it highly recommended by a few different people including professors, so I feel comfortable passing on that recommendation to you. My only big question for this package is how they managed to leave out Yoder's most famous work, _The Politics of Jesus_. Oh well, there's still lots of great stuff there and the integration with so many other resources in the software definitely makes it a far better deal than buying them all individually.
