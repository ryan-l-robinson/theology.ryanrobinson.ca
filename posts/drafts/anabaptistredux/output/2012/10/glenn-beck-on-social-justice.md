At least he doesn't have his TV show anymore? This time around he's saying that "social justice" is a code word for Nazism or Communism and that we should all leave our churches if they support social justice. My favourite part of the video below is the quote from the United Church of Christ pastor pointing out the obvious fact that the Bible is full of calls to social justice. Or maybe the parts that point out that his own faith as a Latter Day Saint is very big on social justice, too. Good to laugh at Beck, but there's some good theology at the end with the interview with Jim Wallis as well. <!--more-->
