Those who have taken part in the Alpha course have likely heard of the Searching Issues material provided as a resource. The book attempts to give answers to the 7 most asked questions on the Alpha course. While I help out with a course that begins tonight, I decided I would like to blog through those questions, sometimes agreeing with the book and sometimes not. Like the book, I know that anything I say are not absolute answers, and that my attempts to say something in 3000 words or less is going to barely scratch the surface on some of them, but I will try. The issues are, in no particular order:

- New Age movements
- [Compatibility of science and religion](http://anabaptistredux.com/science-and-faith/ "Science and Faith")
- [Suffering](http://anabaptistredux.com/the-problem-of-suffering/ "The Problem of Suffering")
- [Issues of sexual orientation](http://anabaptistredux.com/sexual-orientation-3-levels-to-the-question/ "Sexual Orientation: 3 Levels to the Question")
- [Pre-marital sex](http://anabaptistredux.com/pre-marital-sex/ "Pre-Marital Sex")
- The Trinity
- [Other religions](http://anabaptistredux.com/views-of-other-religions/ "Views of Other Religions")

<!--more-->In my personal experience, I never got questions about the New Age movement and never directly about the Trinity (lots about divinity of Jesus but not the doctrine of the Trinity in and of itself). The other big one we got that isn't on the list is about God-sanctioned violence of the Old Testament, and by some interpretations, Revelation. So I will definitely blog on science and religion, suffering, sexual orientation, pre-marital sex, and other religions, and then I'm not sure yet whether I will on New Age movements, the Trinity, or OT violence. We'll see how it goes on those three.
