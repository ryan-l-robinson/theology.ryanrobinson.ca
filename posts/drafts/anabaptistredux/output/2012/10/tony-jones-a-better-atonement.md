With Holy Week right around the corner, it seems like an appropriate time to talk about atonement theologies. Tony Jones has recently released a new book called _A Better Atonement: Beyond the Depraved Doctrine of Original Sin._ I haven't read the book, but I instantly like the title, so I'll try to get a hold of it whenever I have time for this strange concept of casual reading. In the meantime, he recently preached about the topic at Baylor University, so I've embedded the video below for your interest.
