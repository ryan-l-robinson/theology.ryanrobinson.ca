It seems like there is always one interesting article in each month of the United Church Observer about the state of the United Church. This one lists the top 25 theologians, as suggested by a survey of 30 UCC ministers, which they would recommend to their parishioners. I've read some, heard of others but haven't read, and haven't even heard of others. But I do feel proud that when I saw a Twitter post saying "guess who got number 1?", I called it - guess I know something about the United Church. The list is after the break, and if you want to read the whole thing which includes some description of who these people are and some of the recommended books from it, jump over to the Observer page.
