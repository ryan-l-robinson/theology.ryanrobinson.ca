Many people don't have a clue how to use Facebook. They post things online with a lot less thought because they don't realize how easily accessible it is. The same could be said for Twitter, Google+, or any other network, but Facebook is by the most common. [Here's a great blog with a few pointers.](http://peterpilt.org/2012/03/20/christian-ethics-whilst-using-facebook/ "Christian Ethics Whilst Using Facebook") They pretty much boil down to a simple concept: don't send mixed messages. If you're claiming to be a Christian but pick fights over Facebook, or like a photo that is contrary to your faith, etc., then people will easily notice. Remember that we are the ambassadors of Christ, even on Facebook.

<!--more-->Here's the full list quoted from the article:

> - Don’t swear on Facebook.
> - Understand that what you write in the privacy of your home – which kind of gives the sense of it just being you and your computer – is being read very widely – so don’t put overly personal information on your posts.
> - Be careful you are not reactive on Facebook. Think through your posts and if you read something that upsets you – make a comment on it the next day, if at all– when you aren’t so emotional. Saves regretting angry posts.
> - Be mindful that once you put a photo on the internet – it’s pretty much there for good. Sure you can delete the photo – but how many people downloaded and it shared it before you hit the delete button.
> - Understand that your Christian witness can be very effective on Facebook or you can look very hypocritical. Telling everyone about how great church was on Sunday is fantastic, then telling everyone you have had a @$#@ week and you are going out to get blind drunk on Friday – sends mixed messages. Be consistent.
> - When you hit the LIKE button, you are endorsing the photo, the comment or the page – so think it through before liking something that is contrary to your faith.
> - Facebook is great but needs to be controlled from the viewpoint that, is it taking the time we used to spend praying and reading the bible? Spiritual Disciplines should always come first.
> - Don’t have fights on Facebook. If you and your friend are having a disagreement – sought it out one on one. Having a public tiff comes across as immature.
> - Understand what text language actually means before using it. Example OMG or LMFAO – just because its short hand shouldn’t make it acceptable to use bad language or take God’s name in vain.
> - Don’t gossip or be involved in gossip conversations.
> - The bible says in Proverbs that a good name is to be chosen above silver and gold – be intentional with your reputation, which means being mindful of what you post and the impact that has on your reputation.
