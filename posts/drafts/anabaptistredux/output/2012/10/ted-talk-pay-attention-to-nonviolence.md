This is a great message from somebody at a TED Talk.

I've had this same thought a few times. The common complaint against those of us who believe in nonviolence is that it doesn't work. Yes, it depends on how you are defining "work" and I do think there are some big differences there between the priority of the state and the priority of the Kingdom of God. But even in the state's definition, I think it often does work, but we just aren't paying attention to it. I'd like to see more people like Julia talk about the successes of nonviolence and how much it really can change the world if we let it.
