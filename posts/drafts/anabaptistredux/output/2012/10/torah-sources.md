For something a bit different from my usual style, I thought I would share a useful chart. Scholars generally agree that the Torah (or Pentateuch or Books of Moses) were written primarily by four different sources over the years of its development. Generally no scholars still think that Moses wrote the entire Torah as both Christian and Jewish tradition says, although some might theorize that Moses was one of these four sources. From my understanding, that there are four sources with these general characteristics is agreed upon, but there is some debates about the dates, ranging forward from about 1200 BCE to about 500 BCE in estimates I've seen (this chart is on the later end).<!--more-->
