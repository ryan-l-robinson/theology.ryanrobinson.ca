**Update: entries are closed.**

I'm venturing into new territory here for me. I've never done a giveaway before, but let's give it a shot and see how it goes. Up for grabs is a copy of _A Year of Biblical Womanhood_ by Rachel Held Evans. I've been working my way through the book, blogging as I go, and now want to offer up the opportunity for others to also learn from this great book.

### Why?

Most importantly, the book is an extremely good book in so many ways. It is funny, sure to make you laugh out loud multiple times. It is socially-conscious, offering a powerful voice for 50% of the population that somehow are often left unheard in the church. It is incredibly deep in biblical scholarship and in spiritual disciplines drawn from all of the church, plus a few from Judaism. And it is incredibly deep emotionally in terms of how Rachel discusses her own struggles. If you don't win, I highly recommend buying it.

Secondly, I wanted to celebrate. This site is new. Yes, there are 170+ blogs already, but that is because I copied them from previous sites. This site, emerginganabaptist.com, is new. I've also launched [a new Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/AnabaptistRedux?_rdr=p "The Emerging-Anabaptist on Facebook"). And in general, I'm feeling rejuvenated about putting in the time it takes to maintain a good blog. <!--more-->

### How To Enter

You can enter in one or more of 4 ways:

1. Leave a comment on this blog post. With my commenting system Disqus you can log in by Twitter, Facebook, Google, or Disqus.
2. You can follow [@Ryan\_LR](https://twitter.com/Ryan_LR "Ryan_LR on Twitter") on Twitter and tweet this: I entered to win a copy of A Year of Biblical Womanhood by @rachelheldevans from @Ryan\_LR http://wp.me/p2Q8no-db
3. You can [circle me](https://plus.google.com/+RyanRobinson "Ryan Robinson on Google+") and publicly share [this message](https://plus.google.com/+RyanRobinson/posts/41HvX6MbmXv "The Entry Message on Google+") on Google+
4. You can like [The Emerging-Anabaptist page](https://www.facebook.com/AnabaptistRedux?_rdr=p "The Emerging-Anabaptist on Facebook") and like this post on Facebook.

If you do all four, you get four entries, but you only get one entry for each method (i.e. no repeatedly tweeting to raise your chances even farther - I appreciate the publicity but it will count as one).

For Twitter, Google+, and Facebook, you must still be following/circling/liking as of the time I draw the winner. Of course if you're not interested in what I have to say, you have the complete freedom to stop after that. It's not like I'm going to chase you down. I will contact you by whatever means you won through, so make sure you are monitoring those various networks unless you specifically tell me to do otherwise. Obviously, also make sure you've given me a valid means of contact.

Thomas Nelson (the publisher) will be shipping you the book directly. They are awesome. They also shipped out a whole bunch of free copies of Red Letter Revolution (mine will be here soon and that will also likely be reviewed). I'll get your address and send it to them, and they'll take it from there.

The giveaway is valid for Canada and the United States only. Sorry everyone else. About 95% of my hits and I think all of the regulars are Canada-U.S. anyway so I don't feel too bad about it. Thomas Nelson has requested this restriction as it greatly simplifies how many people have to get involved to get it to you.
