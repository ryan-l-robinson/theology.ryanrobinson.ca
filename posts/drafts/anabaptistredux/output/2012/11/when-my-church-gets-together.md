Think being a Christian is no fun? I'd like to think my church proves you wrong. Each of the past two years, my church, The Meeting House, holds a big party called One Roof. For context, we have multiple sites across Ontario but each of the past two years the leadership has decided we should get together to party together. The two videos below are examples of some of the things they put together for these events, one from last year and one from this year. If you get as pumped up by it as I do, there's even a podcast on iTunes called The Meeting House Kingdom Beats where you can download more of these (but only audio, not video).
