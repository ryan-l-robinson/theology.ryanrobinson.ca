Here's some of the cool stuff I've been reading this week that I didn't have the time and/or the insight to devote entire blogs to:

For the fans of my Theology at the Movies series, [Scatterings discusses how the Gospel is represented in The Avengers](http://scatterings1976.blogspot.ca/2012/11/the-gospel-in-avengers-and-another.html "Scatterings: The Gospel in The Avengers").

> Nevertheless, it's striking how a main ingredient of heroism in this movie is not power (almost everyone in the movie is powerful), but the capacity to realize that I might unintentionally cause as much damage or more as a bad guy intends to.

[<!--more-->Till He Comes provides an amusing critique of the emerging church's tendency to create and fight over big words](https://redeeminggod.com/in-other-words/ "Till He Comes: In Other Words").

> Leaders on one side called for “deepening and continuously beautiful efforts toward emotionally true self-divulgence and confession.” Other leaders countered with a call for “a theological re-purposing of our objective and subjective missionality within a framework of God-love.” Because few in attendance actually understood what either side meant, both ideas were tabled.

There have been many great posts following up on the Christian Right's reaction to the election. [Frank Schaeffer asks Christians to choose between hate and Jesus as they consider their response](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/frank-schaeffer/obama-wins-again-christia_b_2088132.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000008 "Frank Schaeffer: Obama Wins: So Christians, Will It Be More Hate or Jesus?").

> Christians who care about our country and our faith have a choice: Circle the wagons tighter, deny reality further, hate more, or admit that once again -- as with the race issues of the 1940s through the 1960s -- that most conservative religious Americans have missed the boat of progress, hope and inclusion.

[And Ryan Streeter points out that there is a growing difference between today's evangelicals and the GOP's evangelicals.](http://ryanstreeter.com/2012/11/09/todays-evangelicals-vs-the-gops-evangelicals/ "Ryan Streeter: Today's Evangelicals vs the GOP's \"evangelicals\"")

> There are many theologically conservative people out there who are growing politically liberal for the reasons the writer mentions: political conservatives have ignored or misunderstood their passion for justice while the left has not. It’s not that Obama has duped them. It’s that conservative candidates are totally out of step with what motivates them.

[Richard Stearns says goodbye to Christian America and hello to real Christianity](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-stearns/goodbye-christian-america-hello-true-christianity_b_2082649.html?utm_hp_ref=tw "Richard Stearns: Goodbye Christian America, Hello Real Christianity").

[The BBC analyzes the GOP's reactions](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-20257611 "BBC News - Viewpoint: Republicans at a Crossroads")

> To treat politics as if it were a kind of religion is to make a category error. It is also to lose touch with reality.

[Bruxy Cavey talks about how we can remember our veterans while maintaining a theology of peace](http://bruxy.com/2012/11/09/we-will-remember/ "We Will Remember - Bruxy Cavey").

> Remembrance Day is not fundamentally a pro-war occasion (no one looks at it that way) – it is about remembering and honouring those who have given their lives sacrificially. We as Christians, of all people, can identify with that concept while maintaining our conviction.

[Sojourners offers a response to some conservative Christian men's claim that Obama won because of "the slut vote"](https://sojo.net/articles/rock-slut-vote "Rock the 'Slut Vote'")... because obviously the only way you would care about women's issues is if you're having casual sex every night.

Somehow at the same time, [Pat Robertson is shocked that women watch porn](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/08/pat-robertson-shocked-that-women-watch-porn-enjoy-fifty-sahdes-of-gray_n_2094829.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000008 "Pat Robertson 'Shocked' That Women Watch Porn").

Continuing the trend, [Suzanna Paul talks about why calling chick flicks emotional porn is not a good comparison](http://www.somuchshoutingsomuchlaughter.com/2012/11/chick-flicks-are-not-emotional-porn.html "Suzannah Paul | the smitten word: chick flicks are not emotional porn").

Krista Dalton talks about how Christians should be viewing our Jewish roots, arguing that while it usually starts with good intentions it often ends up at supersessionism.

[CBC News covers a story about Mennonite Canada's magazine being warned for implying political allegiances which would result in a loss of tax-exempt status](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/mennonite-magazine-warned-about-political-articles-1.1170274 "Mennonite Magazine warned about 'political' articles") (I don't get why the American government doesn't do this to the thousands of churches who explicitly tell their congregants how to vote).

For the academically inclined, [NT Blog looks at how the document claiming Jesus had a wife was forged](http://ntweblog.blogspot.ca/2012/11/the-jesus-wife-fragment-how-forgery-was.html "NT Blog: The Jesus' Wife Fragment: How the Forgery was Done").

[Proof that Mennonites can have fun with this dancing flash mob at Goshen College](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_7F4cxNul4 "Flash Mob").

[Christian Piatt asks if Reformed theology is inherently racist](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christian-piatt/driscoll-piper-calvin-and-gods-gift-of-racism_b_2050070.html?utm_hp_ref=tw "Christian Piatt: Driscoll, Piper, Calvin, and God's gift of... racism?"). I'd never considered it but as soon as I heard it makes perfect sense.

[Rachel Heath challenges us to go where Jesus would go](https://rachelrheath.wordpress.com/2012/11/10/on-going-where-jesus-goes-but-for-real/ "On Going Where Jesus Goes, But For Real - Rachel Heath"), leaving a trail of liberation in our wake.

[Weekly Sift talks about the distress of the privileged, with reference to Dan Cathy of Chick-fil-A](http://weeklysift.com/2012/09/10/the-distress-of-the-privileged/ "The Distress of the Privileged").

Lastly, [Roger Olson asks if Open Theism is just a type of Arminianism and subsequently should be accepted as orthodox](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/rogereolson/2012/11/is-open-theism-a-type-of-arminianism/ "Is Open Theism a Type of Arminianism?"). Then [Greg Boyd responds with similar thoughts](http://reknew.org/2012/11/the-case-for-including-open-theism-within-arminianism/ "The Case for Including Open Theism Within Arminianism").
