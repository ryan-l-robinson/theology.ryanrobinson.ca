Here's some of what I've been reading this week:

[Christianity Today's Her.meneutics blog dismantles the dating myth of what it means for men to be a spiritual leader and why it is hurting many couples](http://www.christianitytoday.com/ "Her.meneutics: \"He's Just Not A Spiritual Leader\" and Other Christian Dating Myths").

> I started wondering about all the godly men who may have other spiritual gifts—just not the ones traditionally considered “male” spiritual gifts. For example, what about men who have the gift of mercy or hospitality or service or encouragement, and who are full of the fruits of the Spirit? Do we devalue them simply because they’re not at the helm or out in front but rather operating alongside their partner? Is initiating devotional activities within a relationship really what it means to lead?
> 
> I wonder whether part of the disappointment and tension among Christian women stems from the fact that they have teaching or pastoral gifts, while their boyfriends or husbands possess other gifts wrongly considered “feminine.” Is it really contradicting God’s will when a woman initiates prayer and Bible study with her significant other? What if her partner models a life characterized by love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith, gentleness, and self-control? Is this not the Jesus life? Is such a man being derelict in his spiritual duties to wife and family?

<!--more-->[Wordgazer's Words picks up the same theme](http://krwordgazer.blogspot.ca/2012/11/men-must-be-spiritual-leaders-real-life.html "Wordgazer's Words: \"Men Must Be Spiritual Leaders\" - Real-World Consequences").

Al Mohler thinks that Democrats winning the election was an evangelical disaster. [Rachel Held Evans, like so many of us, thinks that the real evangelical disaster is how much it has been conflated with being Republican](http://rachelheldevans.com/blog/real-evangelical-disaster "The Real \"Evangelical Disaster\"").

> When I tell a reporter or a new acquaintance that I am an evangelical, inevitably the person will respond, “Oh, so you are a Republican?”  Sadly, evangelicalism has ceased to represent the Kingdom of God, which transcends all political parties and national allegiances, and has come to represent kingdoms of this world.   And so the strengths and weakness of evangelicalism are conflated with the strengths and weaknesses of the Republican Party.

[Greg Boyd on video provides a quick introduction to Open Theism](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=gApXDGjyksw "Greg Boyd - Q & A - What is Open Theism?"), a view that I also support:

Along the same lines, [Greg Boyd concludes a series reviewing _God With Us_ by Scott Oliphant](http://reknew.org/2012/11/how-not-to-be-christ-centered-a-review-of-god-with-us-part-iv/ "How NOT to be Christ-Centered"). You can check out the rest of the series for background, but I think this final piece was especially valuable.

[Chris Lenshyn at Anabaptistly provides a great quote from an Old School Anabaptist, Dirk Philips, about the Incarnation](https://anabaptistly.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/old-school-anabaptists-dirk-philips-on-incarnation/ "Old School Anabaptists: Dirk Philips on the Incarnation"). It's basically the equivalent of the common emerging church line "the Bible isn't the Word of God; Jesus is."

[Garret Menges discusses how our view of the atonement affects how we view victims in our world](https://garretmenges.wordpress.com/2012/11/21/jesus-and-other-victims/ "Jesus and Other Victims | Garret Menges").

[Frank Viola interviews Roger Olson about contemporary evangelicalism](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/frankviola/rogerolson/ "Mixing it Up with Roger Olson").

[Jesus Creed talks about misconceptions in what the book of Job actually says](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2012/11/13/job-is-innocent-and-he-proves-faithful-rjs/ "Jesus Creed - Job is Innocent and he Proves Faithful").

And finally, [Feministe points out the irony of a woman making a career out of telling women they must stay home and not have a career](http://www.feministe.us/blog/archives/2012/11/26/women-need-to-stay-home-and-serve-men-says-woman-who-makes-a-career-out-of-telling-other-women-not-to-have-careers/) including her use of some seriously-distorted research statistics. This line is brilliant so I'll on this:

> Facts, as we know, are for communists and liberals, so let’s go back to Vekner’s completely unsubstantiated assertions and deal with those.
