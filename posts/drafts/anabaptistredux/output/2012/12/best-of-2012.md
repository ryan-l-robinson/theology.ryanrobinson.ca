2012 for me included launching this new blogging platform on October 17th. So there are only a few months worth of statistics but I still felt like summarizing some of the most visited and some of my favourite blogs over those two and a bit months. Most of the posts started out elsewhere and were transferred, so some old ones that I remember being popular elsewhere are also listed here even if they didn't do as well the past two months. As of writing this on December 28th I have had 3720 page views and 94 comments in those two months which I don't think is too bad of a start.

### Most Commented

The most commented post was my [Year of Biblical Womanhood Giveaway](http://anabaptistredux.com/year-of-biblical-womanhood-giveaway/ "Year of Biblical Womanhood Giveaway"), which makes lots of sense since that provided an entry to the contest. After that, the next most-commented on the site was The Dangers of Dispensationalism. Close behind on the site and gathering a fair bit more on my social network feeds was [I Don't Think That Verse Means What You Think It Means: John 14:6](http://anabaptistredux.com/i-dont-think-that-verse-means-what-you-think-it-means-john-146/ "I Don’t Think That Verse Means What You Think It Means: John 14:6").

### Most Viewed

Also after the Giveaway, my most-viewed post was my analysis of [what Batman Begins has to say about fear](http://anabaptistredux.com/batman-begins-on-fear/ "Batman Begins on Fear"). Also cracking 100 pageviews were [my post critiquing Kathy Kellens' response to A Year of Biblical Womanhood](http://anabaptistredux.com/kathy-keller-vs-rachel-held-evans/ "Kathy Keller vs Rachel Held Evans?") and my discussion of [the Real #FirstWorldProblem](http://anabaptistredux.com/the-real-firstworldproblems/ "The Real #FirstWorldProblems"). [My review of In Time](http://anabaptistredux.com/in-time-where-time-is-money-literally/ "In Time: Where Time Is Money… Literally") and posts on [Biblical Manhood](http://anabaptistredux.com/biblical-manhood/ "Biblical Manhood"), [Eschet Chayil](http://anabaptistredux.com/eschet-chayil/ "Eschet Chayil"), and [the aforementioned post about John 14:6](http://anabaptistredux.com/i-dont-think-that-verse-means-what-you-think-it-means-john-146/ "I Don’t Think That Verse Means What You Think It Means: John 14:6") also could hit that milestone by the end of the year.

### Personal Favourites

For some of my personal favourites, I really enjoyed my entire series on A Year of Biblical Womanhood. That also claims my Book of the Year title, by the way. I also had a lot of fun with [Ways I Am A Heretic](http://anabaptistredux.com/ways-i-am-a-heretic/ "Ways I Am A Heretic") even though most of my readers seemed to think there was nothing heretical about most of it and [my discussion of the documentary Hellbound?](http://anabaptistredux.com/hellbound/ "Hellbound?") And recently [I questioned some of the terrible responses given to the Newtown shooting](http://anabaptistredux.com/in-response-to-the-newtown-shooting/ "In Response to the Newtown Shooting") which was hardly a fun post but I felt was one of my more important ones.

Did you have any favourites from the blog these few months, or even any from the previous blog locations?
