Here's some of what I've been reading this week:

Let's start with some fun: Bethlehemian Rhapsody

<!--more-->Sticking with the Advent theme, [John Shore gives an introduction to the Christian calendar](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/johnshore/2010/11/why-is-today-meaningful-for-christians/ "Advent, Easter and Ordinary Time"), something that many Christians are no longer familiar with.

In light of the recent events in Israel/Palestine, Jonathan Martin applies the Politics of Jesus to the situation.

[Timothy Dalrymple asks if it is time for (American) evangelicals to stop opposing legal same-sex marriages](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/philosophicalfragments/2012/11/26/is-it-time-for-evangelicals-to-stop-opposing-gay-marriage/#comment-13842 "Is It Time for Evangelicals to Stop Opposing Gay Marriage?").

> And yet…the question at hand is not whether we should abandon the historical Christian teaching on marriage.  The question is whether we should contend for laws and regulations that give this vision of marriage the sanction of government.  And to make one more distinction: the question is not whether Christians _have the right_ to promote their views, just like everyone else does, and to support or oppose laws on any grounds they wish, including religious grounds.  There’s nothing categorically wrong with supporting laws and politicians who recognize and affirm what marriage actually is, even if your view of marriage is religiously informed.  The question, rather, is whether _it is still wise_ to press for American law to recognize only heterosexual unions.Experimental Theology talks about the gifts and benefits of doubt.

[The LA Times goes a step further and presents the Christian case for gay marriage](http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/02/opinion/la-oe-pearce-christianity-gay-marriage-20121202 "The Christian case for gay marriage").

[Dianne Anderson offers a word of caution against those who think that the pain of the privileged is equivalent to the pain of the oppressed](http://diannaeanderson.net/?p=1675 "Checking Privilege: A Lesson in Pain").

One of the most encouraging things I saw this week was [this article from The Atlantic discussing how many men are calling for and living the end of a violent, simplistic and macho understanding of manhood](http://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2012/11/the-end-of-violent-simplistic-macho-masculinity/265585/ "The End of Violent, Simplistic, Macho Masculinity").

On a related note, Rob Davis says Farewell to Mark Driscoll, Mars Hill Church, and the damaging form of Christianity it presents by telling the story of his own MHC experience.

For the flipside, [Charisma Magazine lists 10 lies that the church tells women](http://www.charismamag.com/life/women/8236-unveiling-biblical-truth-ten-lies-the-church-tells-women "10 Lies the Church Tells Women") and [the Abnormal Anabaptist Robert Martin asks if his mother was sinning by being a pastor](https://abnormalanabaptist.wordpress.com/2012/11/29/was-my-mother-sinning/ "Was my mother sinning?").

The American Sociological Association presented a report about perception of their peers who hook up too much. Here are some of the results:

> According to the study, approximately 48 percent of the college students in the survey were egalitarian conservatives—meaning they judge men and women with similar sexual  histories by the same standard and lose equal respect for members of both genders who they believe hook up too much. In addition, roughly 27 percent of the students surveyed were egalitarian libertarians (i.e., they lose respect for neither men nor women regardless of how much they hook up); nearly 12 percent held a traditional double standard (i.e., they lose respect for women, but not men, for hooking up too much); and approximately 13 percent held a reverse double standard (i.e., they lose respect for men, but not women, for hooking up too much).

[Alan Knox points out that by our modern standards Jesus was a terrible evangelist](http://www.alanknox.net/2009/07/jesus-was-not-a-very-good-evangelist/ "Jesus was not a very good evangelist").

Going back to The Atlantic, [here's another great article talking about the problems with slaughterhouses](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/11/slaughterhouse-rules/309113/ "Slaughterhouse Rules").
