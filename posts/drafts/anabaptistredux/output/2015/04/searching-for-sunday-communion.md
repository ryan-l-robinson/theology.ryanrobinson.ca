![Searching for Sunday](images/Searching-for-Sunday-198x300.jpg)A little over eleven years ago, I was in Merida, Venezuela receiving communion. It was the conclusion of a short-term mission trip. Our team was comprised approximately equally between teenagers affiliated with my hometown's United Church (myself included) and its Anglican Church. After our host prayed, he invited us forward two at a time. We served each other the elements, hugged, and sat back down.

I think that was the first time I experienced something in communion that I could not explain. It was not simply memory of who Jesus was, although that was definitely there. It was simply a nice snack with a group of people who had spent a week together, although that was definitely there, too. It felt like something else, something too big for me to pinpoint then or now.

<!--more-->In Rachel Held Evans' section of _Searching for Sunday_ on communion, she captures so many of my thoughts on communion in recent years.

### My Need of the Eucharist

In the first chapters of the section, Rachel focuses on why communion is so important as a discipline for Christians. Many of those ideas could be summarized with this quote:

> I need the Eucharist because I need to begin each week with open hands.
> 
> I need the Eucharist because I need to practice letting go and letting in.
> 
> I need the Eucharist because I need to quit keeping score.

The last point will tie in a bit more to the next chapter (below), but the first two remains among the most powerful images of the Eucharist for me as well. Once, I led a Eucharist for a small group with somebody who hadn't done it before. He was supposed to hand the cup and bread to me after I handed it to him. He didn't. I'm not holding any bitterness or blaming him for that, but I still remember it because it didn't allow for me to be open and receive the Eucharist. Instead, I reached out and took it for myself.

Receiving the Eucharist is fundamentally an act of admitting our hunger. In some traditions, you kneel with your hands open then open your mouth as the common cup is raised to your lips. It's not quite a foot-washing, but you have to be humble to do that.

That is something we all need, whether we realize it or not.

### The Table for the Hungry

My favourite quote of the book so far was this:

> This is what God's Kingdom looks like: a bunch of outcasts and oddballs gathered at a table, not because they are rich or worthy or good, but because they are hungry, because they said yes. And there's always room for more....

It is closely followed by later in the same chapter:

> The church is God saying, 'I'm throwing a banquet, and all these mismatched, messed-up people are invited. Here, have some wine.'

This I'm sure is where she can get more controversial, particularly with an offhand potshot at the Gospel Coalition whose entire purpose seems to be to keep people out. I'm not sure it's a coincidence that it is often those who do not regularly practice communion that are the most judgemental groups of Christians. When communion is done right, it can't help but remind us that it is a radically equal table. We can debate exactly how "open" the official sacrament in church services should be - personally I'm not opposed to saying it is meant for Christians so long as you are providing some equivalent of an open table that makes it clear God has invited everyone to the party (a way of dividing common among Anabaptists). Wherever exactly you draw that line, it should always be a tool for bringing people in to the family, never a tool for keeping people out.

All of my most powerful communion experiences have come when it was with people in some significant ways different than me. That afternoon in Venezuela, I shared communion not only with Anglicans from my town, but also Presbyterian and Pentecostal locals. Twice I attended Urbana conferences with 17,000+ Christians from every tradition and all over the world. I have taken communion with some I would be tempted to dismiss as godless liberals and others I'd be tempted to dismiss as bigoted fundamentalists who couldn't look any less like Jesus. I've also taken it with many who would be tempted to apply one or the other to me as well.

I'm not convinced the sacrament is limited to church walls, either. When my single mother was raising us and we often received food from others in the church, that was communion. When ministries go out and offer sandwiches to those hungry on the streets, that is communion. When we gather together in our homes and pass the plate around, that is communion. We may or may not ever say Jesus' name, but when we act as he acts, we remember him.

It is a table for all. It doesn't matter your health, your wealth, your intelligence, your race, your gender, your sin history, or any other factor we like to divide over. Jesus invites you to the table.

Take, eat, Jesus' body broken for you. Take, drink, Jesus' blood poured out for you. Do this in rememberance of him.
