![Canadian Bible Society. The Word. For Life.](images/CBS-logo_lg.jpg)With my work for the Canadian Bible Society, I have been converting some old PDF newsletters into HTML5 formats. One newsletter - [Word @ Work Winter 2010](http://biblesociety.ca/sites/default/files/magazine/WAW_Winter2010.pdf "Canadian Bible Society - Word @ Work winter 2010") - included this helpful chart copied here. Therefore the following content is copyright of the Canadian Bible Society, not me. Note that since it was from 2010, it isn't completely up to date, e.g. the newest revision of NIV or a personal favourite the Common English Bible (CEB).

<!--more-->Bible Translations can be grouped into three translation styles:

- Formal Correspondence – a literal approach that seeks to transmit into English as closely as possible the words and the structure of the original language.
- Dynamic Equivalence – a meaning based approach that seeks to transmit into English as closely as possible the meanings and concepts of the original language.
- Paraphrase – a more interpretive approach, which may simplify the text and restructure it in order to make the meaning clearer.
