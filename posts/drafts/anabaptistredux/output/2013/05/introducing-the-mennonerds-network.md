I'm proud to announce that the Emerging-Anabaptist is part of a new network called [MennoNerds](http://mennonerds.com "MennoNerds"). Ok, so if you follow me on Twitter or even regularly follow the blog, you've probably heard of this and it isn't really "new." But I've finally gotten the site to the point that I feel comfortable promoting it. So here's a quick introduction:

### What Is It?

We're a group of Anabaptist/Mennonite bloggers from around North America (hopefully including some from other parts of the world over time). Along with our theological tendencies most of us also happen to be of the nerdy variety so it isn't a coincidence that pretty much all of us met through Twitter or other social networks. Just use the #MennoNerds hashtag on Twitter and one of us will probably see it.

### What Do We Do?

Primarily we blog. The MennoNerds site at its core is simply an aggregator of our respective sites. Some are very regular bloggers. Some are less frequent bloggers. But we all are interested in how to best pursue discipleship to Jesus in our contexts, particularly operating through an Anabaptist lens.

We also are investigating podcasts. As of writing this, we've done a test Google Hangout through the [Anabaptist Alliance Community](https://plus.google.com/communities/115410163627448794752 "Anabaptist Alliance on Google+"). We intend to do some more, probably about every two weeks, and start recording them to upload to the site and YouTube.
