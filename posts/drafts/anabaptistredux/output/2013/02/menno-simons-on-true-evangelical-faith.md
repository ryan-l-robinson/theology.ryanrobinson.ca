This is a great quote from Menno Simons, after who Mennonites take their name, on what he considers the necessary parts of evangelical faith. Whether he would still use the term evangelical today with all its baggage is debatable - the concept of evangelicalism being equated to political conservativism, as one example, would make him roll in his grave - but it is interesting that this is what it meant to him 500 years ago when the term had very different connotations.

> For true evangelical faith is of such a nature that it cannot lay dormant; but manifests itself in all righteousness and works of love; it dies unto flesh and blood; destroys all forbidden lusts and desires; cordially seeks, serves and fears God; clothes the naked; feeds the hungry; consoles the afflicted; shelters the miserable; aids and consoles all the oppressed; returns good for evil; serves those that injure it; prays for those that persecute it; teaches, admonishes and reproves with the Word of the Lord; seeks that which is lost; binds up that which is wounded; heals that which is diseased and saves that which is sound. The persecution, suffering and anxiety which befalls it for the sake of the truth of the Lord, is to it a glorious joy and consolation.
