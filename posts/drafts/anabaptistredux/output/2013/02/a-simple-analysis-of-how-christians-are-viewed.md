This chart came from [Frank Viola's post about how the world is watching the way Christians treat each other](http://frankviola.org/2013/01/14/warning/ "Warning: The World is Watching How We Christians Treat One Another"). You should read the whole post, but I thought that this pretty much said it all when it comes to how religions are viewed by outsiders. These search terms of course don't mean that those stereotypes are true for every single member of the religion but they don't come from nowhere either. Every single one for Christians is negative and often are similar to the results found in research by the Barna Group for _unChristian_ and _You Lost Me_. The only way to change these stereotypes is to show everyone something better.<!--more-->
