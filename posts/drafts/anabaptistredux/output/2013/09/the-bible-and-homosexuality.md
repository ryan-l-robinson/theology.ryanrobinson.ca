I've done several posts explaining how I believe that the Bible does not address homosexuality as we speak of it today: committed long-term relationships just like opposite-sex relationships. There are a whole lot of people who agree with this position, although there are also clearly a few very loud voices who tend to demand the media attention. I've never encountered this speaker before, but he is very good at explaining the long journey he has taken to conclude what he has.

Regardless of whether you end up agreeing with Matthew or disagreeing, you would be doing yourself and everyone else a disservice to refuse to consider what he has to say. You would be choosing judgement over grace, politics over people, us over them. Let's try to reach a dialogue, instead of conservative fundamentalists yelling at liberal fundamentalists and liberals giving it right back. Start by listening.
