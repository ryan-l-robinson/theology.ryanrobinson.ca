This video is great, capturing something very important: everyone, even the best of us, operate in a cycle of carrying forward hurt. Jesus calls us to reverse the cycle by spreading loving service to others instead. In other words, Jesus is more interested in a restorative justice than in a retributive justice, especially a retributive justice with the inherent biases that come with being human.
