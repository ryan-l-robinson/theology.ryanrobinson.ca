This Holy Week, Greg Boyd gave us a few short videos discussing why Jesus died. In the first, he discusses some of the problems with penal substitution theory. In the second and third, he explains Christus Victor (aka "classical" theory) instead. I haven't dwelt on this discussion too much lately but it is a very important one and I have been finding myself more interested in it again lately.
