If you're one of the lucky few million who have already picked up a BlackBerry Z10, you can grab The Emerging-Anabaptist app from BlackBerry World. It's a pretty simple app which displays the content feed for this site and allows for easy sharing through a variety of networks. There are some minor limitations - embedded videos don't make the jump, for example - but it is a great way to follow along with the site's content RSS feed as well as [my Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/AnabaptistRedux?_rdr=p "The Emerging-Anabaptist on Facebook").
