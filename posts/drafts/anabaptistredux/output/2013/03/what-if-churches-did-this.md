Honest question. Imagine what kind of a church culture we could build if we did stuff like this even occasionally. Just because our mission is serious doesn't mean that our mission is supposed to be no-fun. In fact, the Kingdom of God is supposed to be fun, so we really are failing in our mission if we aren't enjoying ourselves and inviting others to enjoy themselves. Jesus is Lord! Let's celebrate!
