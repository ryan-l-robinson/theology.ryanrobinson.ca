If you're struggling to get your head around what separates Anabaptism from other Christians, I think this is the heart of it: we view Scripture through the lens of Jesus as we believe that this is how Scripture and Jesus speak of their own relationship. Most of the things which stand out as distinct - nonviolence, church-state separation, adult baptism, etc. - derive from this Christocentrism. Greg Boyd explains it really well in this sermon from a couple of weeks ago.
