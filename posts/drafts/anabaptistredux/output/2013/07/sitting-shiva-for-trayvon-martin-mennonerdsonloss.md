_I had another post planned today to begin our MennoNerds syncroblog series on mourning/grief/death/illness/loss. Last night's decision in the George Zimmerman case, however, has led me to want to start with this instead._

In the Jewish tradition, there is a designated mourning period of 7 days for first-degree relatives after the death of a loved one. In that time, friends and family members come and sit with those mourning. The visitors do not talk or try to offer the usual pat answers and condolences, unless instigated by the primary mourners. They just sit and mourn together. Today I shut up my usual theologizing and sit shiva, from a distance, with those mourning the loss of Trayvon Martin and the incredible systemic injustice it represents.
