### The Question At Hand

Since the Enlightenment, a question that has lain dormant for centuries has moved more and more to the forefront: how does the church relate to the state?  For over a millennium of Christendom, from Constantine onwards, the concept of a church-state union, or at least a close connection between church and state, was essentially assumed.  Now, we have a post-Christendom world where the majority of Christians embrace a separation of church and state at least in some sense.  To be able to wrestle with these questions in the present, it is a valuable asset to look into the church’s past and how this question has been answered before.

<!--more-->In terms of how the church and the state relate to one another, the church’s history can be divided into three general eras.  In the first pre-Christendom era, there was a very strong separation of the church from Roman society and especially Roman politics and military.  With the conversion of the Emperor Constantine in what Mennonite theologian John Howard Yoder calls The Constantinian Shift, there was “a fundamental reorientation of the relationship of church and world.”\[1\]  A new era was ushered in, as Christianity suddenly became not only legal but then heavily promoted by the state.  This era of Christendom would last for over a millennium, before slowly beginning to fade out in the Enlightenment.  Now there are few nations that think of themselves as being governed by Christian ideals, with the only possible exception being some political movements in the United States.  Although the transition may not be entirely complete, we have now entered post-Christendom.

The focus of this paper lies in the first two eras and the shift that moved the world from one to the other.  Key figures before Constantine who will be examined are Jesus and Paul in the biblical record, and Tertullian in the second century.  As the shift begins to happen, key figures include Lactantius, Constantine himself and Eusebius of Caesarea.  After the shift we see a very different attitude towards the state in church leaders such as Ambrose of Milan and Augustine of Hippo, with some important exceptions to that majority in those of the monastic movement and the schismatic Donatists.

#### Underlying Question: The Nature of the State

Before being able to delve into the primary discussion of the historical shift, however, there is a fundamental philosophical question as to the nature of the state.  Specifically, much of the debate focuses on whether the state is inherently opposed to the Kingdom of God toward which Christians are called to live.  Some argue that violent imperialism has been the norm of civilization at least since written history began and so “if you oppose Empire-as-such, you are taking on what has been the normalcy of civilization’s brutality for at least the last six thousand years.”\[2\]  Many others would argue against this point stating that although history has yet to show otherwise, it is theoretically possible to have a church-state union that does not compromise either.  As shall be seen throughout history, those theologians before Constantine would have agreed with the former assessment, while those through the age of Christendom starting with Constantine would have agreed with the latter.

### Before Constantine

#### The Early Church: Biblical Perspectives

While it could be argued that the church’s history should include the entire period of the writing of the Bible, including the Hebrew Bible,\[3\] for the sake of this paper I will begin with the life of Jesus.  As part of this post-Christendom theology now being discussed, one of the primary questions is what Scripture itself says.  The conclusion for most is that the texts of the earliest church as found in the New Testament are radically anti-Empire.  For example, while many theologians throughout history have fundamentally blamed the Jews as a race for the death of Jesus, there is increasing acknowledgement of the role played by Pilate in particular and the _Pax Romana_ principle of peace through violence in general.\[4\]

In one Gospel story, the Pharisees, who opposed the Roman governance, and the Herodians, who supported it, team up to try to trap Jesus.  They ask him whether it is lawful to pay taxes to Caesar.\[5\]  Whether he says yes or no, he has been forced to either side with the state or to oppose it.  Jesus doesn’t pick a side, however, and instead makes the picture much bigger by taking a third option: “Give… to the emperor the things that are the emperor’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”  While there are various interpretations of exactly what this means for the church-state relationship, one thing is clear: the church and state are distinct, and that in itself was a radical claim to both Jewish and Gentile readers.\[6\]

It is often stated that the people of Judea did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah because they were expecting a conquering king.  He constantly declared the bringing of a new Kingdom, which would only reinforce that idea.  Did he then fail to deliver, or was he bringing a type of kingdom different than imperialism?  The New Testament texts point to the latter, or at the very least it points to an imperialism fundamentally different than Rome’s.  Even much of the language choices are borrowed from terms used by the Roman Imperial religion,\[7\] setting up a challenge through a similarity on the surface that is radically different underneath.

While Jesus was treated as a political revolutionary, he did not respond in kind.  Soldiers came to arrest him armed “as against a bandit.”  When Peter responded with a similar reaction, cutting off the ear of one of the soldiers, Jesus stopped him and instead healed the man’s ear.\[8\]  Paul carries on many of these themes, even telling his own story in a way that would draw parallels to Graeco-Roman kings, but with major themes of suffering for Christ and others instead of exploitation of others. \[9\]  Jesus came, it seems, to establish a different kingdom, but one with a completely different modus operandi of non-violence and forgiveness, not violent oppression.  Even though they were also still claiming to be Jews and thus not even a new religion, it did not take long for the first persecutions from the state to come through Emperors Nero (64 CE) and Domitian (90’s CE).\[10\]

Revelation is a primary example.  Believed to be written during one of those earliest persecutions,  the book is primarily about remaining strong against the Roman Empire (whether it is also prophetic as to the details of the end of the world is debatable).  Using a thinly-veiled analogy of Rome as Babylon – another Empire who had conquered God’s people previously – John of Patmos describes the Roman Empire as something very unlike the ally it would become later:

> The great whore who is seated on many waters, with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and with the wine of whose fornication the inhabitants of the earth have become drunk… The woman \[representing Rome/Babylon\] was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and jewels and pearls, holding in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her fornication; and on her forehead was written a name, a mystery: “Babylon the great, mother of whores and of earth’s abominations.”  And I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints and the blood of the witnesses to Jesus.\[11\]

In summary, although Paul was proud of his Roman citizenship and both he and Jesus taught that Christians should pay taxes,\[12\] the message of the New Testament authors is inherently opposed to the Roman Empire of their day.  As this paper will show later, this way of talking about the Empire in the late first century would be very different than the way it is spoken of by those such as Eusebius in the fourth century.

#### Tertullian

Of course it is not hard to argue in this particular case that the problem with the state was its “abominations” and not necessarily statehood in itself, but in any case it is evident that the church did not seem to show any interest in being involved with that particular imperial state.  This attitude continued up until the legalization of Christianity with the Edict of Milan, although the severity of the distinction between church and state did slowly begin to dull over time.  The work of Tertullian provides the best primary source writings on this question, specifically his works _On Idolatry_ and _Apology_.

In the first, written to Christians, Tertullian interprets the same text mentioned in the previous section about rendering to Caesar what is Caesar’s and to God what is God’s.  This interpretation leads him to believe that Christians should remain loyal citizens of the Empire, including payment of taxes, so long as it does not contradict what is due to God.  Specifically as the title suggests, this work deals with worship of idols, and he calls his fellow Christians to be separate from the state in this important way:

> ‘One has to render to Caesar what is Caesar’s.’ Fortunately He added: _and what is God’s to God_.  What, then, are the things of Caesar?  They were, namely, those things which gave rise to the discussion, whether the poll-tax should be paid to the emperor or not.  It is for this reason that the Lord demanded to be shown a coin and asked about the image on it, whose it was.  When He had heard that it was Caesar’s he said: _render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s and to God the things that are God’s._  He meant that the image of the emperor, which is on the coin, should be rendered to the emperor and the image of God, which is in man, to God.  Consequently you should render to the emperor your money, to God yourself.  Otherwise, what shall belong to God, if everything belongs to the emperor?\[13\]

Tertullian, like most of the early church, saw the church and state as very distinct things that inherently could not fully get along.  However, they were not always opposed either.  Tertullian’s _Apology_ was addressed to Roman officials in defence of Christians as loyal members of the Empire.  Arranged in the form of a court trial, _Apology_ deals with the charge of treason being placed against Christians for their separation from the state.  The heart of the argument for treason is that Christians do not offer sacrifices to the emperor as they are supposed to.  Tertullian uses logic to express that the emperor cannot be helped by the sacrifices to other gods because those “gods” depend on the Empire to even be able to accept them, and therefore this type of worship is actually harming the emperor as it wastes his materials:

> Let it be established whether those to whom sacrifice is offered can grant health to the Emperor or to any man at all.  Certainly, they should first protect their own statues, images, and temples, which, I believe, the emperor’ soldiers have to keep safe with guards.  Moreover, those very materials for them come, I think, from the emperors’ mines, and entire temples depend upon the nod of the Caesar.  If the gods are so completely in Caesar’s power, and belong to him so completely, how can they have Caesar’s welfare in their power?\[14\]

He follows from there to claim that Christians are actually more valuable to the state because instead of offering those meaningless or even harmful sacrifices, they:

> Pray for the welfare of the Emperors to the eternal God, the true God, the living God… From him comes the emperor, from whom came the man also, before he became the emperor; from him comes the emperor’s power, from whom as well came the breath of life.  Looking up to him, we Christians constantly beseech him on behalf of all emperors.  We ask for them long life, undisturbed power, security at home, brave armies, a faithful Senate, an upright people, a peaceful world, and everything for which a man or a Caesar prays.\[15\]

#### The Early Church’s Separation

As much as Tertullian and other Christians claimed otherwise, they were still a new and mysterious religion that did not fit in with the rest of the life of the Empire.  In general, the Christian attitude seemed to be to try “to have their cake and eat it: to demonstrate their active and useful loyalty… while keeping within guidelines of acceptable Christian behaviour.”\[16\] Yet two common assumptions that are made of why Christians were persecuted seem to have little basis in fact.  It was not that Christians were living perfect lives in the midst of total debauchery.  Neither was it (after the times of the New Testament) that they were evangelizing publicly.  “What really offended was the opposite: Christian secretiveness and obstinate separation into their own world.  For Christians, such separation was inevitable.”\[17\]

Part of the most offensive aspects of this separation from the state was the Christian refusal to serve in the military.\[18\]  While there is some debate about what particular issues were predominant as to the reasons for this unanimous refusal, there is no real debate about it representing a choice between God and Caesar.  Some suggest that it primarily was a matter of the idolatry of the army, others suggest the problem of taking an oath to Caesar, and others argue that they rejected all violence.\[19\]  Whatever the reasons, there was a clear line between Christian priorities and Empire priorities.  This line gradually became less strict over time for a variety of reasons, including increasing loyalty to the Empire and more lax discipline brought against those in the church who did not quit the army,\[20\] before culminating in total legalization and then endorsement with Constantine.

### The Constantinian Shift

#### Lactantius: Early Signs of a Change

Regardless of lax church discipline, the issue of violence was one which did still have a strict line unanimously in church leadership.  This was true even for those working within the Imperial system, such as Lactantius:

> When God forbids killing he not only forbids us to commit brigandage, which is not allowed even by the public laws, but he warns \[us\] that not even those things which are regarded as legal among men are to be done.  So it will not be lawful for a man to serve as a soldier… nor to accuse anyone of a capital offense…it is killing itself that is forbidden.  So in this commandment of God no exception at all ought to be made to the rule that it is always wrong to kill a man, whom God has wished to be \[regarded as\] a sacrosanct creature.\[21\]

Lactantius demonstrates that even though some lines were still pretty strict, the context of Christians working with the state in important positions was already happening.  The hard line between church and state had slowly been softening over time.  Thus in one sense, Constantine’s conversion of himself and then the Empire is perhaps not that surprising.

#### Constantine’s Conversion: The Pivot Point

Constantine was clearly the most influential person in the shift of the relationship between church and state.\[22\]  However, it was not as sudden as a shift as may be suggested by the fact that Rome went from persecuting Christians under Diocletian in the first decade of the fourth century to forming a strong alliance with them under Constantine in the second decade.\[23\] Yet even if the shift was not absolute and sudden, much of the shift does still come down to the conversion and later decisions of one man, the emperor Constantine.  As with the shift in theology for the church as a whole, Constantine’s own conversion story is perhaps not as dramatic and sudden as it is sometimes told.

The story of that conversion is recorded in three places: two by Christians Lactantius and Eusebius, plus a shorter reference from Gelasius of Caesarea.  In one, the story as told by Lactantius in his work _On the Death of the Persecutors_, Constantine received his vision in a dream near Rome just before the battle of Milvian Bridge which was crucial in his rise to power.  Gelasius’ reference is similar, claiming that at Rome Constantine saw something in the sky.  The two accounts can be combined if you assume that the dream came after initially seeing the sign in the sky, and then Constantine proceeded to have the _labarum_, the Christian symbol of the Chi-Rho (the first two Greek letters of Christ), emblazoned onto the shields of his soldiers.\[24\]

The most complete story of Constantine’s conversion essentially combines these two aspects in _The Life of Constantine__,_ the work of church historian Eusebius of Caesarea_._  In his account, Constantine first considers what he would need in order to win the upcoming battle.  He acknowledges that the strength of his army is meaningless and sees the losses of many before him who had practiced the traditional Roman religion.  Eventually, he concludes that “it was folly to go on with the vanity of the gods which do not exist.”\[25\]  Eusebius then proceeds to tell the story of Constantine’s vision which led to his conversion and the use of the _labarum_ as his war symbol:

> This God \[of his father\] he began to invoke in prayer, beseeching and imploring him to show him who he was, and to stretch out his right hand to assist him in his plans.  As he made these prayers and earnest supplications there appeared to the Emperor a most remarkable divine sign.  If someone else had reported it, it would perhaps not be easy to accept; but since the victorious Emperor himself told the story to the present writer a long while after, when I was privileged with his acquaintance and company, and confirmed it with oaths, who could hesitate to believe the account, especially when the time which followed provided evidence for the truth of what he said?  About the time of the midday sun, when day was just turning, he said he saw with his own eyes, up in the sky and resting over the sun, a cross-shaped trophy formed from light, and a text attached to it which said, ‘By this conquer.’  Amazement at the spectacle seized both him and the whole company of soldiers which was then accompanying him on a campaign he was conducting somewhere, and witnessed the miracle.
> 
> He was, he said, wondering to himself what the manifestations might mean; then, while he meditated, and thought long and hard, night overtook him.  Thereupon, as he slept, the Christ of God appeared to him with the sign that had appeared in the sky, and urged him to make himself a copy of the sign which had appeared in the sky, and to use this as protection against the attacks of the enemy.\[26\]

A few noteworthy things stand out from this account.  Firstly, contrary to how Constantine’s conversion is often told, it was not completely sudden like that of Saul on the road to Damascus.\[27\]  According to this story, Constantine rejected the pagan gods and sought out the true God first.  Constantine is presented as a very genuine and thoughtful convert.  A second noticeable aspect of this text is the shift in understanding of the military.  As established earlier, even right up to this point, Christians unanimously rejected war, yet in this text God is a warrior god whose primary role in the story was assistance in a military victory.

One of the frequent historical debates about the story of Constantine is that of the genuineness of his conversion.  Christians were still a minority, but a very significant one at about 10 percent of the Roman population, and were spread out across the entire Empire, making them enough of a potential threat if they ever chose to act against the Empire.\[28\]  Some hold to the traditional tale of a genuine conversion.  Others point to the fact that Constantine continued to worship the Unconquered Son as well,\[29\] or that he wasn’t baptized until his deathbed, and even that came without proper catechetical instruction,\[30\] and thus claim that his conversion was purely political.

#### Constantine’s Involvement in the Church

However genuine the conversion of Constantine, he quickly became involved in guiding the church and not just the state.  When the Arian controversy broke out in Alexandria, Constantine stepped in, first by sending his adviser Ossius with a letter that would essentially ask the two parties “to recognize their ultimate unity while agreeing to differ on such minor questions.”\[31\]  They refused to do so, and the matter was later officially settled at the Council of Nicaea, which was again initiated by Constantine.  At the Council, Constantine himself was there and active in the discussions, even being the one to put forward the word _homoousios_ (“of the same essence”), probably at the suggestion of Ossius.\[32\]  This term would become central to the debate, and it is an interesting question to ask whether the Council would have concluded the same things if not for the presence and input of their emperor.  The fact that it is ultimately an unanswerable question in itself demonstrates that the church and state were already beginning to be significantly more involved in the decisions of the other.  Constantine has thus caused a major shift, quickly moving toward a much stronger relationship between the church and state within a matter of two decades.  Yet at the same time, Arius and Alexander still felt it permissible to disagree with his orders, so it was not a total caesaropapism either.

While the turning point came down to Constantine, the conversion of the Roman Empire had slowly begun earlier and would continue for some time afterward.  Some describe this shift as a good thing and Constantine as “a truly great Christian Emperor and a genuine apostle of the Christian Church.”\[33\]  Others claim that Constantine’s imperialized theology was inherently contradictory to the aims of Jesus and the church up to that point.\[34\]  Setting aside the theological biases, perhaps the fairest assessment of Constantine would be to look at this shift from his viewpoint:

> Constantine was a child of his age.  His Christianizing mission, which had arisen with the Persecution, would have disposed him to favor the Catholic Church… His aim of making the empire safe for Christianity must have entailed the prompt conversion of a large number of pagans.  He did not have a doctrine of the separation of Church and State available to him: if he had accepted God’s mission, how were Caesar’s things to be distinguished from God’s?  He believed that the empire needs the prayers of Christians, that God had entrusted the empire to him, and that it was his responsibility to do as well as he could by the Church.\[35\]

### After the Constantine Shift

#### The Early Dissenters: Monastics and Donatists

Beginning soon after Constantine, the attitude toward the state shifted quite quickly, but it was not unanimous.  Two main categories of opposition to the state-embracing mainstream theology arose: monastics and Donatists.  The central protest of these groups was that Christianity was not supposed to be easy or for everyone:

> How was one to be a true Christian in such circumstances? When the church joins the powers of the world, when luxury and ostentation take hold of Christian altars, when the whole of society is intent on turning the narrow path into a wide avenue, how is one to resist the enormous temptations of the times?  How is one to witness to the Crucified Lord, to the One who had nowhere to lay his head, at a time when leaders of the church live in costly homes, and when the ultimate witness of martyrdom is no longer possible?  How to overcome Satan, who is constantly tempting the faithful with the new honors that society offers?\[36\]

Monastics had already been present to a lesser extent before Constantine due to a variety of other factors including the influence of Gnosticism, but were definitely aided in their opinion as the Roman Empire became a Christian state. Some of these monastics lived solitary lives while others formed communities.\[37\]  This monastic ideal of standing up to the Imperial Church would continue all through Christian history, although not always leaving society behind.  For example, the condemned Waldensians and the similar-but-approved Franciscans came much later from an analogous viewpoint of the church needing to rid itself of the wealth of empire, but did so while remaining active for the needs of those around them.\[38\]

The Donatists responded in a different and more problematic way.  Rather than withdrawing from the church, they declared themselves the true church since the institutional imperial church had been corrupted.  As with monasticism, this movement was not a new one, beginning after persecutions around issues related to whether those had abandoned their faith under pressure should be allowed back into the church and its leadership. \[39\] Ultimately Augustine would most effectively quiet the issues brought up by the Donatists, but much earlier Constantine himself “tried very hard to heal it \[the schism\], and failed.”\[40\]

#### Official Imperial Theology: Eusebius of Caesarea

The official and majority theological response to Constantine’s shift is most visible in Eusebius of Caesarea, as well as in Augustine of Hippo, who both argued that God was governing history through Constantine and the now-Christianized state in general.[\[41\]](file:///J:/Documents/MDiv/741%20-%20Early%20and%20Medieval%20Christianity/Papers/Final%20Paper%20-%20Christian%20Attitudes%20to%20the%20State.docx#_ftn41)  Eusebius’ famous work, _Church History_, was the first of its kind and has provided historians with much information about the early church up to his time.  However, it was more than just a history as it aimed to essentially argue this point that the Imperial Church was the culmination of God’s plan for the world.  For Eusebius, as with Augustine and most of those who followed them, “faith and the Empire, like faith and philosophy, were not really incompatible”[\[42\]](file:///J:/Documents/MDiv/741%20-%20Early%20and%20Medieval%20Christianity/Papers/Final%20Paper%20-%20Christian%20Attitudes%20to%20the%20State.docx#_ftn42) which had been an assumption up to this point.

In discussing the previous persecuting rule of Licinius, Eusebius expresses how Constantine was an earthly saviour for Christians:

> 15\. The deeds which he \[Licinius\] performed at Amaseia and in the other cities of Pontus surpassed every excess of cruelty. Some of the churches of God were again razed to the ground, others were closed, so that none of those accustomed to frequent them could enter them and render the worship due to God….
> 
> 19\. And he would have succeeded in his design, and there would have been nothing to hinder him in the work, had not God, the defender of the lives of his own people, most quickly anticipated that which was about to happen, and caused a great light to shine forth as in the midst of a dark and gloomy night, and raised up a deliverer for all, leading into those regions with a lofty arm, his servant, Constantine.
> 
> 1\. To him, therefore, God granted, from heaven above, the deserved fruit of piety, the trophies of victory over the impious, and he cast the guilty one with all his counselors and friends prostrate at the feet of Constantine….
> 
> 6\. But Constantine, the mightiest victor, adorned with every virtue of piety, together with his son Crispus, a most God-beloved prince, and in all respects like his father, recovered the East which belonged to them; and they formed one united Roman empire as of old, bringing under their peaceful sway the whole world from the rising of the sun to the opposite quarter, both north and south, even to the extremities of the declining day.  7. All fear therefore of those who had formerly afflicted them was taken away from men, and they celebrated splendid and festive days. Everything was filled with light, and those who before were downcast beheld each other with smiling faces and beaming eyes. With dances and hymns, in city and country, they glorified first of all God the universal King, because they had been thus taught, and then the pious emperor with his God-beloved children.  8. There was oblivion of past evils and forgetfulness of every deed of impiety; there was enjoyment of present benefits and expectation of those yet to come. Edicts full of clemency and laws containing tokens of benevolence and true piety were issued in every place by the victorious emperor.  9. Thus after all tyranny had been purged away, the empire which belonged to them was preserved firm and without a rival for Constantine and his sons alone. And having obliterated the godlessness of their predecessors, recognizing the benefits conferred upon them by God, they exhibited their love of virtue and their love of God, and their piety and gratitude to the Deity, by the deeds which they performed in the sight of all men.\[43\]

To summarize that official theology:

> the scheme of history that Eusebius developed led him to set aside a fundamental theme of early Christian preaching: the coming Kingdom of God.  Although Eusebius does not go as far as to say so explicitly, in reading his works one receives the impression that now, with Constantine and his successors, the plan of God had been fulfilled.\[44\]

#### Ambrose and Theodosius

With this theology in place, it would still need to be wrestled out in practice over the centuries that followed.  In an early clash between the bishop Ambrose of Milan and the emperor Theodosius, some zealous Christians had burned a Jewish synagogue in Callinicum.  As punishment, Theodosius decreed that they must rebuild the synagogue.  Ambrose objected, claiming that “a Christian emperor should not force Christians to build a Jewish synagogue” even though that probably would have been fair.  Opponents of the church-state union see this as a very problematic precedent that would continue throughout Christendom, as non-Christians were now being persecuted much like Christians had been before Constantine.\[45\]

A more famous disagreement between the two would come later, and it is often cited as an example of the tension of the church-state relationship, although it can be argued that it isn’t as clear or as powerful as is often portrayed.  As Theodosius fought off others for the throne, one turning point in his victory included killing thousands of people in a stadium in Thessalonica.  Ambrose’s response shows the use of just war criteria negatively, as a check against war:\[46\]

> An act was committed at Thessalonica which is unprecedented in human memory, an act whose perpetration I could not prevent, an act which previously, in so many petitions, I had warned would be an atrocity, an act which you yourself condemned as brutal when you revoked it too late.  That act I could not extenuate.  When the news was first heard a synod had assembled because of the arrival of the Gallic bishops: no one was there who did not lament, nobody who took it lightly.  Your being in communion with Ambrose was not seen as a ground for acquitting you.  No, the indignation at your deed would swell still further, if no one was saying that you would need to be reconciled to God….
> 
> I persuade, request, encourage, advise because I am filled with grief that you, who set an unprecedented example of piety, who occupied the summit of clemency, who would not allow individuals to be endangered even if they were guilty, do not mourn the destruction of so many innocent people.  Although you have been highly successful in battles, although you merit praise in other respects also, nevertheless the crown of your achievements has always been your piety.  The devil has envied you this, your most excellent possession.  Conquer him while you still have the means to conquer.  Do not add another sin to your sin to cling to something which has proved injurious to many who have clung to it….
> 
> I have, I can claim, no reason why I should display contumacy towards you, but I have reason to be afraid on your behalf.  I dare not offer the sacrifice, if you intend to be there.  Or is what is not allowed when the blood of one innocent victim has been shed, allowed when the blood has been shed of many?  I do not think so.\[47\]

A few things of note stand out from this letter.  For one, Theodosius is still clearly cared for by Ambrose.  Ambrose does not take on a tone of condemnation, but a tone of concern, emphasizing heavily the piety of the emperor and essentially arguing that Theodosius is a better person than this action portrayed.  Underlying the reason for such a letter is an assumption that there is a strong connection between the two men which is representative of the relationship between the church and the state.  They are distinct, having different values, but are heavily influential to one another.

Secondly, church discipline is still taken seriously, even against the emperor.  This situation is actually the reverse of some of the actions of Constantine discussed earlier. Ambrose gets involved in directing Theodosius’ leadership of the state in the same way that Constantine got involved in the leadership of the church with the Council of Nicaea and against the Donatists.  The connection between church and state is still very strong, but throughout medieval history it was a two-way street of each playing important roles in the decisions of the other.

#### The Development of a Christian Just War Theory

On the issue of violence which had been a strict separation between Christian values and Empire values, Just War Theory became appropriated by the church as its way of settling the conflict.  In the above quote from Ambrose, there is a third noticeable change.  The role of violence has taken on the tone which would be the majority opinion until the Protestant Reformation: it may be allowed in certain circumstances, but those circumstances needed to meet the criteria of Just War Theory.

After Rome was plundered by the Goths, many Romans fled to North Africa where Augustine was leading, and there was strong speculation that the fall of Rome came because they had abandoned the old gods.  The work _City of God_ in general was written “with designs to solidify the Christianization of the Roman world”\[48\] but as part of that, Just War Theory was formalized as a Christian idea.  In Book XIX, Chapter 7, Augustine acknowledges that “the imperial city has endeavoured to impose on subjects… her yoke.” He also refers to the “many great wars… And though these are past, the end of these miseries has not yet come.”  However, even if they are miserable, Augustine argues that “the wise man will wage just wars” but will “lament the necessity of just wars.” \[49\]

This leads to an important theme throughout the life of Just War Theory in the church, and it serves as a primary example of the tension between church and state.  The church did abandon some of its teaching of complete non-violence.  However, for most theologians of medieval history, including Augustine, violence was still wrong.  It was just sometimes necessary as the lesser of two evils, specifically as a lesser evil than the troubles caused by not having a Christian emperor.  Just War Theory was therefore intended as a check against war, a way of restraining the state, as opposed to a way to find excuses for war as it is sometimes negatively presented. \[50\]  While war was allowed during the medieval period of the church’s history, it wasn’t actually until the Protestant Reformation that war became significantly more acceptable for a Christian.\[51\]

### Summarizing Thoughts

Throughout the early and medieval church’s history, there was a fundamental shift on the understanding of the relationship between church and state.  In the first century during the writing of the New Testament, the church was radically anti-Empire from the teachings of Jesus and Paul to the extremely insulting imagery of Revelation.  During the following two centuries the trend was essentially the same, as embodied best by Tertullian’s works _On Idolatry_ and _Apology_.  However, before the total shift of Constantine, there was some softening of the divide between church and state, as represented here by the writings of Lactantius.  Constantine and his conversion provided the dramatic turning point to fundamentally shift the understanding of church and Empire.  Although specific debates of precisely how the church and state related to each other did not occur until the eleventh and twelfth centuries,\[52\] it was assumed that they did relate to each other and were not separate.  This came from the theology developed through Eusebius and then Ambrose and Augustine. No longer was God seen as subverting and opposing the Empire, but instead God was seen as using the Empire for his glory, even in violence which had previously been condemned.

As we now enter the post-Christendom era, the fundamental question remains: which side had it right?  Is the church called to subvert the state or to work through it?  Or were they both right, and it was a matter of context?  Essentially it comes to the question of the nature of the state and whether it is inherently opposed to the goals of the Kingdom of God.  As we go through a similar shift now, it will be up to today’s church to determine the answers to these questions and to shape the next era of Christianity.
