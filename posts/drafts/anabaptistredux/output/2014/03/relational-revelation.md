Within [an overall great sermon from Bruxy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMc3MXFAjpk&list=PLB5r2P47beqIqzVRyXtafs40a-Y5iDXk4 "The Meeting House - Life 2.0 #3") recently, I really liked this piece about relationality, particularly in what is a bit of a tangent on how we approach Scripture as relational revelation.
