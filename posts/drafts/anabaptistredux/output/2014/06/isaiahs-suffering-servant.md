2nd Isaiah is probably most famous for the poems to the suffering servant. This servant figure isn't named, so our first instinct is usually to guess who it is referring to. Some scholars suggest that it was meant to be Isaiah himself. Others suggest that it was to be a representation of all of Israel or another individual who was instrumental in achieving the return from Exile. The earliest Christians applied these to Jesus - there's no doubt of the parallels. In any case, this figure had a unique and essential role as a martyr.

At the heart of this martyr's witness we see that this Servant gives himself over to government oppression but in doing so frees his people, a statement that would not have sat well with the Persian leadership:<!--more-->

> 53 Has anyone believed us or seen the mighty power of the Lord in action? 2 Like a young plant or a root that sprouts in dry ground, the servant grew up obeying the Lord. He wasn’t some handsome king. Nothing about the way he looked made him attractive to us. 3 He was hated and rejected; his life was filled with sorrow and terrible suffering. No one wanted to look at him. We despised him and said, “He is a nobody!”
> 
> 4 He suffered and endured great pain for us, but we thought his suffering was punishment from God. 5 He was wounded and crushed because of our sins; by taking our punishment, he made us completely well. 6 All of us were like sheep that had wandered off. We had each gone our own way, but the Lord gave him the punishment we deserved.
> 
> 7 He was painfully abused, but he did not complain. He was silent like a lamb being led to the butcher, as quiet as a sheep having its wool cut off. 8 He was condemned to death without a fair trial. Who could have imagined what would happen to him? His life was taken away because of the sinful things my people had done. 9 He wasn’t dishonest or violent, but he was buried in a tomb of cruel and rich people.
> 
> 10 The Lord decided his servant would suffer as a sacrifice to take away the sin and guilt of others. Now the servant will live to see his own descendants. He did everything the Lord had planned.
> 
> 11 By suffering, the servant will learn the true meaning of obeying the Lord. Although he is innocent, he will take the punishment for the sins of others, so that many of them will no longer be guilty. 12 The Lord will reward him with honor and power for sacrificing his life. Others thought he was a sinner, but he suffered for our sins and asked God to forgive us. (53)

There is another important point here. We often assume that God is on the side of the powerful. We assume that when someone suffers at the hands of the powerful that it is true justice, that they deserved it. Among other things, this scapegoating impulse often gives us the excuse to not wrestle with injustice. This text - like so much of the Bible - says the opposite, though: God was on the side of the Servant, using him and his suffering as a way to stand up against the powerful oppressors. How exactly this sacrificial death brings about the end of the Exile isn't explained, much like how precisely Jesus' death on the cross freed all of humanity is not explained (what theologians call atonement theories). What we can say is that God was on the side of the oppressed even though we typically assume the opposite, and that oppressive violence was defeated through subversive non-violence.

### 3rd Isaiah (Post-Exile)

3rd Isaiah sounds in many ways like [the monarchic period prophets like Amos, Hosea, and Micah](http://anabaptistredux.com/prophetic-justice-amos-hosea-and-micah/ "Prophetic Justice: Amos, Hosea, and Micah"). After returning from Exile, many of the societal inequalities were reinstated, although the text is light on historical details so it is hard to say exactly what time was being referred to. One of my favourite biblical texts come from this section:

> 2 Day after day, you worship him and seem eager to learn his teachings. You act like a nation that wants to do right by obeying his laws. You ask him about justice, and say you enjoy worshiping the Lord.
> 
> 3 You wonder why the Lord pays no attention when you go without eating and act humble. But on those same days that you give up eating, you think only of yourselves and abuse your workers. 4 You even get angry and ready to fight. No wonder God won’t listen to your prayers!
> 
> 5 Do you think the Lord wants you to give up eating and to act as humble as a bent-over bush? Or to dress in sackcloth and sit in ashes? Is this really what he wants on a day of worship?
> 
> 6 I’ll tell you what it really means to worship the Lord. Remove the chains of prisoners who are chained unjustly. Free those who are abused 7 Share your food with everyone who is hungry; share your home with the poor and homeless. Give clothes to those in need; don’t turn away your relatives. (58:2-7)

[Like the first 2 Isaiahs](http://anabaptistredux.com/isaiahs-hope/ "Isaiah’s Hope"), 3rd Isaiah promises that God will restore those who have been oppressed. There will be some kind of judgement, but like the first two Isaiah authors, he is incredibly hopeful toward the future, painting a beautiful picture of God's character is primarily interested in restoring the world and freeing the captives. This could sum up his overall message, a text quoted by Jesus in Luke 4 but with a noticeable omission (I'll talk about that later):

> 61 The Spirit of the Lord God has taken control of me! The Lord has chosen and sent me to tell the oppressed the good news, to heal the brokenhearted, and to announce freedom for prisoners and captives. 2 This is the year when the Lord God will show kindness to us and punish our enemies.
> 
> The Lord has sent me to comfort those who mourn, 3 especially in Jerusalem. He sent me to give them flowers in place of their sorrow, olive oil in place of tears, and joyous praise in place of broken hearts. They will be called “Trees of Justice,” planted by the Lord to honor his name. 4 Then they will rebuild cities that have been in ruins for many generations. (61:1-4)
