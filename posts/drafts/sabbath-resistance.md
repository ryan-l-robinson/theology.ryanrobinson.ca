### Intro: Why Sabbath?

Pop quiz: why are we instructed to rest on the Sabbath? Either from the Bible, or what you heard from churches in the past?

The Ten Commandments are given in two different places in the Bible, in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5. In Exodus 20, it says this:

> 8 Remember the Sabbath day and treat it as holy. 9 Six days you may work and do all your tasks, 10 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. Do not do any work on it—not you, your sons or daughters, your male or female servants, your animals, or the immigrant who is living with you. 11 Because the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and everything that is in them in six days, but rested on the seventh day. That is why the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.

This is closer to the rationale that I mostly heard from church growing up: God rested on the seventh day of creation, so on the seventh day we need to set aside a day solely for worship. Of course that idea of Sabbath blurred into our Sunday morning worship. That's a different day, Sunday instead of Friday night to Saturday. It's also different instructions, worshipping rather than resting, although resting was usually encouraged for after church. I mean, other than the matriarch of the house who probably had to make a big dinner. But overall, this was the sentiment: Sabbath is about remembering to make time for God. That certainly doesn't seem like a bad thing. It's also straightforward enough that I was never going to get a whole sermon out of that.

Let's try a different text. In Deuteronomy 5, it says this:

> 12 Keep the Sabbath day and treat it as holy, exactly as the Lord your God commanded: 13 Six days you may work and do all your tasks, 14 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. Don’t do any work on it—not you, your sons or daughters, your male or female servants, your oxen or donkeys or any of your animals, or the immigrant who is living among you—so that your male and female servants can rest just like you. 15 Remember that you were a slave in Egypt, but the Lord your God brought you out of there with a strong hand and an outstretched arm. That’s why the Lord your God commands you to keep the Sabbath day.

Did you catch that? What the Sabbath means they were supposed to do is basically the same: do no work on he seventh day, and that extends to servants and animals and immigrants. But WHY they were supposed to keep the Sabbath is different. This one links the idea of Sabbath to the story of God's rescuing the Hebrew people from slavery in Egypt.

That, I think, also explains why this rule also applies to servants and animals and immigrants who may not even worship the same God. If Sabbath is about worshipping the god of the Hebrew people, why would animals need to rest? Why would immigrants, who probably do not subscribe to the same religious system? They don't care that the God of the Israelites rested on that day and they certainly don't plan on worshipping that God? But with this Deuteronmy explanation, it starts to make more sense to me. The Israelites are reminded of what it was like to be constantly worked, to be denied any kind of rest, and God says, "no, you cannot do that to yourselves again or inflict it on others again." There is one way of operating in the world, like the Egyptians who forced their slaves to work constantly. And there is another way, where even servants are given time off because their inherent dignity is more important than retaining the hierarchy of others ruling over them.

## Luke 13

In the Luke 13 text, Diana Butler Bass points out an interesting twist in the language. Jesus says that the woman is "set free." As Butler Bass says:

> The Greek word, apoluó, means to be completely released, pardoned, set free. It is the same term used for “divorced.”

Then the religious leaders criticize Jesus for "curing" her on the Sabbath. Butler Bass continues:

> The word in Greek is therapeuó. But the story doesn’t say that Jesus cured her; she wasn’t simply relieved of a particular condition. It says that Jesus liberated her, with its use of the word, apoluó. She wasn’t just cured. She was completely, fully released from that which had bound her.
> And, as Jesus pointed out to the blinkered religious leader, liberation was the entire point of sabbath. The sabbath was meant to be a day of release from enslavement to worldly economic and social systems, intended to ground Israel as a community formed by the principles of God’s Kingdom. A community of Exodus. The command to keep the sabbath had been given them while their newly freed bodies were still bent by Pharaoh’s yoke. When Moses came down from the mountain with the law to keep sabbath, the people barely knew the meaning of full release.
> Sabbath wasn’t just about taking time off from work and resting. Sabbath was a weekly practice of God’s economy of generosity and gratitude — and learning that sacred provision was, indeed, abundance. Sabbath is what a truly freed people should not only do — but what they should be.
> What could be more appropriate on sabbath than liberating those held in bondage? Unbending the bodies of those twisted by corrupt systems of economics and religion?

### Rest as Resistance

There's a third version of this that I've heard more often in the modern world. It goes like: it is important to rest so that you are ready to keep doing things as effectively as possible. If you don't rest because you're pursuing all the things you "need" to be doing, you'll wear out and end up getting a lot less down, so it's actually counterproductive. That's completely true. There's good research to back it up. We can't do the same thing effectively for extended periods of time, so we do need to rest or at least change it up to using different parts of our bodies and brains or else we end up with the worst of all worlds: we're less healthy, have less flexible, and our reward for that is getting less work done. If you want to be productive, you need to rest.

But I've also become convinced that rest in itself is an act of resistance against a world that demands constant production, that declares that we are worth less when we aren't producing. Choosing to simply be human and be content with that, especially in the presence of other humans, is an essential tool in reminding ourselves that we are not defined by our productivity or our consumption. If we only see the value of rest to be that we can then be more productive, that might help us rest but it also reinforces that our worth is tied up in our productivity.

### Types of Rest

Even when we are allowed to stop producing for a moment, we are expected to use that time to consume the production of others instead. I have a constant watchlist of TV and movies, and a constant backlog of videogames. I like a lot of that TV and those movies and truly value the storytelling power of some of them. But it does feel like it's just another chore of being a good cultural consumer sometimes. Much of the time, consuming that media is relaxing - especially the videogames that I find to be a great balance of engaged without straining. But is it restful? I'm not sure that's the same thing.

Some have identified different types of rest. I find this valuable. The one I feel most acutely is sensory rest. Sometimes I don't need to sleep, but I do need to simply lie down in a quiet dark room. I need some time where my brain is not processing a podcast or an audiobook or a TV show or that chore or that project that I'm working on. I need to just be.

My favourite thing in the summer is the festival season in my region. Many weekends there is some festival. I rarely care about the reason for the festival. There's one with classic cars. I do not care about classic cars. But it can be one of my favourite things to simply walk outside with a bunch of other relaxed people while other people show off the work of their hobby.
