Many years ago I was a regular blogger. I was even one of the founding members of the MennoNerds network of bloggers and podcasters. But blogging largely faded out in the face of social media dominance, and I found myself wanting to focus the majority of my energy on my local church community rather than writing for the public.

The latter half of that is still true. The majority of my energy is for my local church, not here. And I definitely won't blog about every Christian controversy of the day the way that I used to. But I have found myself wanting a place to put some things, like sermons that I already prepared for that local church priority, or even some longer form thoughts that were initially shared on Bluesky or Mastodon that I want to also be somewhere more permanent.

So, here is the beginning of getting that to work. I've got the same technical framework for it as [my tech blog](https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca). I've got a few drafts to finish up. And maybe if I really find some free time at some point, I'll even convert some of my old blogs that I still have in a WordPress backup to work here.
