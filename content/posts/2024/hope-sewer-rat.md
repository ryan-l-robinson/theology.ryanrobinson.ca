I love this poem I've seen go around social media a couple of times, called Hope is a Sewer Rat by Caitlin Seida.

> Hope is not the thing with feathers
That comes home to roost
When you need it most.
>
> Hope is an ugly thing
With teeth and claws and
Patchy fur that’s seen some shit.
>
> It’s what thrives in the discards
And survives in the ugliest parts of our world,
Able to find a way to go on
When nothing else can even find a way in.
>
> It’s the gritty, nasty little carrier of such
diseases as
optimism, persistence,
Perseverance and joy,
Transmissible as it drags its tail across
your path
and
bites you in the ass.
>
> Hope is not some delicate, beautiful bird,
Emily.
It’s a lowly little sewer rat
That snorts pesticides like they were
Lines of coke and still
Shows up on time to work the next day
Looking no worse for wear.

Maybe sometimes hope actually is the delicate bird that arrives just when you need it and reminds you of a better world. I'm not ruling that out. But a lot of the time, yeah, I think it's the sewer rat, something that gets beat up by the world over and over again and yet, if we choose to, it comes back for more.
