description: I attempt to nuance some of the masculinity discourse with four questions.

I semi-regularly see some form of discourse going around about masculinity being attack or a male loneliness epidemic. I usually see this on micro-blogging social media like Bluesky, where there are small character limits and there is never any room for nuance, so it is usually a lot of "obviously it's true and bad that masculinity is under attack" or "obviously men are just immature and should shut up about it." A lot of the time I see either one and think that's reasonable, but maybe needs some more nuance that doesn't fit in so few characters, so I decided I would take a stab at it in a longer form.

As I see it, there are really a few overlapping questions at play here.

## Is the Attack on Strict Binary Norms, or on Masculinity?

First, I need to acknowledge that a lot of people aren't trying to define masculinity (whatever that is - see next question). Sometimes they're really trying to defend the concept of a strict gender binary that everyone must adhere to. By a strict binary, I mean that there are certain things that all men absolutely must do and certain things that all women absolutely must do. There is no room for deviance. You must be either male or female and it almost certainly is whatever a doctor assigned at your birth. Even if you accept the general gender identity, you must not deviate from the prescriptions of what is required for that gender identity to do.

I'm not going to waste a lot of time on saying this is bad. Around a decade ago I was doing a lot more writing defending equality of women and trans people. In my context, we've all moved on a long time ago. Gender is not a strict binary. Even the "well it's obvious biologically" argument falls apart as soon as you realize intersex people exist. You can try to force people to follow certain gender rules, and you might succeed in ruining some lives that way, but you're never going to be able to force everybody to be something they're not.

The rest of this post I'll assume that we are talking about the attacks on "masculinity" and not just defenders of a strict binary. There is some overlap between the two versions, of course, in that the people most adamantly defending the binary are usually doing so because they believe that binary includes a hierarchy. If an attack on strictly enforced binaries is an attack on the power structure and the power is what defines masculinity, then sure, these are the same thing.

In that case, that takes us to the next question.

## What Is Masculinity?

This is the biggest one. What are we even talking about? What is "masculinity" that is being attacked? There is a wide range of answers that get thrown around.

### The Bad

There are the inherently bad ideas with seriously bad consequences, like:

- Men inherently should hold power over women
- Men shouldn't express any emotions (except anger, which is usually treated like it is not an emotion when its by men)
- A man's worth is defined by his paycheque
- Men shouldn't clean or care about personal hygiene
- Men are constantly horny sex robots who cannot help but objectify women (I think this is the one I picked up the most)
- Men are never going to be as mature as women and so should never be expected to be responsible for their actions

There are some truly absurd ones that occasionally get into my feed via people mocking them. A lot of this is tying back into the first question: these manosphere influencers have built their brand off of constantly policing what is true manliness and sometimes that descends into some extremely weird things (and some sponsored things).

Those are the things that are bad if anybody of any gender accepts them. It is not healthy to live your life this way. You are going to hurt yourself and others.

### The Ones We Need Both

There might be some other things that are legitimately true that _on average_ (important caveat) have some differences between men and women, and we need both. Some of those might be natural, some might be societal, and some a combination of the two, but I'm not too worried about that part.

Male friendships are more often "side by side" working on or enjoying some other shared thing. Female friendships are more often "face to face" directly communicating with each other. Both of those are good things. It would be bad if everybody could only do one or the other. Ideally, all of us have some of each, but it's fine if most of us skew one way or another as long as both are still present in good numbers at the group level.

Men are generally physically stronger. We occasionally need some people around who can do things requiring physical strength.

Obviously when it comes to reproduction, there are two essential components.

### The Neutral

There are some surface level things that are silly to associate with masculinity but the thing itself is fine. As a rural Canadian boy, it was definitely assumed that I would love hockey. I did like hockey, at least for a while. I still think it can be fine, but am not generally going to make the time and energy for following it closely. It's fine to love hockey. It's also fine to not love hockey. We do not as a society need a certain contingent of hockey lovers.

We could do the same thing with other ideas like cooking on a BBQ or watching action movies. They're neutral, as long as it is not pressured or enforced.

### The Good Values

Finally, there are the ones that are about social values which are absolutely essential in a functioning society and at least used to be more typically associated with masculinity.

I'm going to build off the idea of power, but instead of naming the reality and declaring it a good thing that must be defended at all costs, I think there's a lot to be said about a vision of masculinity that is about using that power well.

One big idea with a lot of history is that masculinity is about protection and provision for others. Masculinity was best defined by Jesus; yes, there is power but that power is sacrificed out of love for other.

The problem that could come in is when they are tied to the strict enforcement of the binary, because then we start having a contradiction: the binary must be maintained, the binary requires that men have more power, and the values for men is to sacrifice that power out of love. When that contradiction has happened, in recent years it really seems like the "maintain power" side of the equation has largely won out. Kristen K Du Mez's _Jesus and John Wayne_ gets into a lot of this very well.

Men were supposed to be respectful.

Men were supposed to tell the truth, even when it was hard.

Men are supposed to show courage, taking a stand for the right thing even when it might hurt them in the short term.

None of this means that those values can't also be embraced by women, but they are things which used to have a stronger connection to concepts of masculinity.

In many ways, these are good impulses. It is good to care about others, especially those who have societal power. It is good to consider their needs and sacrifice of your own power to lift them up. The version of Christianity I grew up I think was often saying this, albeit less directly than in many other churches.

## Is It Under Attack? By Who?

Then the next question is whether it is under attack. Is the narrative even true? If it is under attack, by who?

For the neutral definitions, the answer is mostly no. Nobody is trying to ban you from public life because you like hockey or using a BBQ.

Are the bad ideas under attack? Those are the ones that I do get popping into my feed occasionally, pointing out that yes, it is bad that a lot of men are immature or struggle to treat women as equals.

I occasionally see criticisms of what I put in the "we need both" column, like the types of friendship, but I don't think there's any serious social movement there, just some social media jokes that don't always land.

The values I absolutely do think are under attack, primarily from the right wing. They openly talk about how empathy is evil, that we should only care about ourselves. More importantly, they model it constantly in public settings to the heights of power including billionaires and the White House. It is a full-frontal assault on the very concepts of decency, compassion, and truth.

## Should That Version of Masculinity Be Attacked?

How you answer the previous questions will determine how you feel about this ultimate question. Maybe your definition of masculinity is under attack. Is that a good or bad thing? Sometimes the short-form discourse just assumes that whatever masculinity is, it should not be attacked. I would suggest that some of the bad ideas I've mentioned above should be attacked. The strict enforcement of a binary should be attacked. Those are harmful things.

It's not about attacking men. It's about naming the dangerous ideas that hurt men as well as people of other genders.

Of course, the opposite is also true. I've named some things that I consider good values that were previously associated with masculinity and that are under serious sustained attacks. I do not think this is a good thing. I think it is causing a lot of social harm as well as individual harm to people of all genders.
