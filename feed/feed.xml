&lt;h2 id=&quot;transcript&quot;&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;intro-recapping-the-series-so-far&quot;&gt;Intro: Recapping The Series So Far&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re up to the third of four weeks in a series about Sabbath. This is already the second time in this series that you&#39;ve heard a version of the Ten Commandments used as one of the Scripture texts. Bert also used a very similar text a couple weeks ago, but his was from Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Exodus version, the reason for the Sabbath was given as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 Because the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and everything that is in them in six days, but rested on the seventh day. That is why the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sabbath there in Exodus is linked to the creation poem. It is a reminder that this is a God who is immensely creative, but it&#39;s not perpetual productivity for the sake of constant growth. This is a God who gets to the point of supporting abundant relationship with humans and says &amp;quot;ok, that&#39;s very good, time to rest.&amp;quot; So, the Sabbath is to remember the presence of that loving God who created a very good world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is most clear and the same between the two Ten Commandment texts is what you are supposed to do: rest. That was Marlene&#39;s topic last week. The Sabbath is a reminder of the worth of humanity. We need to take care of ourselves, including regular rest. Our worth, our being loved by that creative God, is simply in our humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recap those ideas because I think they are the important basis to continue building to this week&#39;s topic, Sabbath as Resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;rest-for-all&quot;&gt;Rest for All&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s another big idea that is in both versions of the Sabbath command: the command to rest applies to everybody. It&#39;s for you, your children, your servants, your animals, and immigrants living among you. The Deuteronomy version even repeats the servant part a second time, in case you didn&#39;t catch it the first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we need to pause for a second to recognize that&#39;s the radical part. It&#39;s never been radical that those with wealth and power take regular rest. A quote I saw going around social media said, &amp;quot;modern luxury is the ability to think clearly, sleep deeply, move slowly &amp;amp; live quietly in a society designed to prevent all four.&amp;quot; Rest is often presented as a luxury for those with enough privilege to get away with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads into how the Deuteronomy text diverges the most from the Exodus one. Once we get to WHY the Sabbath is commanded, it&#39;s a completely different reason:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 Remember that you were a slave in Egypt, but the Lord your God brought you out of there with a strong hand and an outstretched arm. That&#39;s why the Lord your God commands you to keep the Sabbath day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Exodus version links the command to the creation poem and God&#39;s rest. This one links the idea of Sabbath to the story of God&#39;s rescuing the people from slavery in Egypt, a time when they could not rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God says, &amp;quot;you cannot do that to yourselves again or inflict it on others again.&amp;quot; The inclusion of servants and immigrants and even animals in the rest is explicitly discouraging using a religious rule as an excuse to exploit others. It is not &amp;quot;I have to rest, therefore you, slave, should do it for me.&amp;quot; That would be easy and common, just another way for those with the privilege to rest to push down those others who do not have that privilege. It would be the same as Egypt did to them, but now they&#39;re at the top of the pyramid of power instead of the bottom. Instead, the command says, &amp;quot;I have to rest and I have to honour your rest, too, especially when you have less power than me like a servant or an immigrant.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a statement of resistance to the way of Pharaoh that God has just brought them out of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fear-and-dehumanization&quot;&gt;Fear and Dehumanization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let&#39;s follow the reference in this Deuteronomy version back to what they are being told to remember, that time as slaves in Egypt. I went back to start at Exodus 1, which seemed like a logical place to start the story of the exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a big idea in here that I had overlooked in other times reading it. Sometimes you don&#39;t notice something until you start to really sit with it for a sermon, and then it seems obvious in hindsight. It&#39;s honestly one of the best things about doing this once or twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire explanation for why Pharaoh decided to enslave a whole group of people was because he was afraid of them. The Israelites weren&#39;t even doing anything scary, as far as the text says at least. There is no inciting incident mentioned of the Israelites first expressing a desire to overthrow Egyptian leadership. But Pharaoh got scared that there were &amp;quot;too many&amp;quot; people who were different than him. Without any more reason than that, he becomes afraid that he will no longer hold all the power over them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did what anybody who is driven by fear of losing power does; he tries to reassert his power by flexing it against them. You know, it&#39;s kind of like when one world leader points out that another world leader is unreliable and just likes to throw power around to benefit himself. Then that second world leader responds with threats and publicly kicking the first world leader out of the club of the super cool leaders who give the second world leader money and promise to never say mean things about him. The second world leader is kind of proving the first world leader&#39;s point. &lt;em&gt;heavy sarcasm&lt;/em&gt; Obviously this is purely hypothetical, definitely not the kind of thing that happens every day now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, when throwing power around doesn&#39;t work to calm Pharaoh&#39;s fears, he escalates even more, and the Egyptians started looking at the Israelites with &amp;quot;disgust and dread.&amp;quot; In other words, they start viewing them as less human and needing to be enslaved. It was all because Pharaoh was afraid that the mere presence of difference would threaten his power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who already have a lot of power and privilege are often terrified of human difference and try hard to convince us that we should be, too. They cannot imagine a world that is not governed by a desire to rule over those who are different. That means difference itself is a threat that requires escalating violence to contain. They might think they will be happy and feel secure as soon as they assert just a little bit more control, but they never will. Because the real problem was not people being different. It was their fear, and they&#39;ve put themselves in this cycle of becoming increasingly afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-quest-for-more-power&quot;&gt;The Quest for More Power&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we proceed forward to chapter 5, we see another related factor in Pharaoh&#39;s motivation. He makes the Israelites produce just as many bricks but refuses to give them straw to be able to do it. There are a couple of ways we could read this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first instinct was to assume that there is no way Pharaoh genuinely believed that the Israelites could make just as many bricks with less resources. Therefore, he must have just been doing it to be cruel and to feel more powerful by comparison. That&#39;s textbook bullying behaviour. We certainly see a lot of that in the news, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I remember how this all started with fear of difference leading to dehumanization. In Exodus 5:9, after Moses and Aaron have asked basically for a weekend off to worship God, Pharaoh says to &amp;quot;make the men&#39;s work so hard that it&#39;s all they can do, and they can&#39;t focus on these empty lies.&amp;quot; He wants to scrub away any kind of humanity that they are still trying to claim, any reason for their existence, like a God that cares about them. He wants them to only exist to make bricks for his profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we see how the dehumanization and the seeking of more power go hand in hand. This cycle might get started from either direction, but once it starts, the two pieces can keep feeding into each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes me think maybe Pharaoh really did believe he could squeeze out a little bit more profit. If the Israelites aren&#39;t human in his eyes, if they purely exist for his gain, why not save a little bit more by not providing materials? That seems consistent with Pharaoh&#39;s mindset. It&#39;s also consistent in how a lot of big corporations operate today, trying to sap out every bit of value for their shareholders no matter how much it hurts their customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feedback loop of fear and rationalizing hurting others for profit is easiest to see with the wealthiest among us. You don&#39;t get to be super rich without exploiting some people along the way. The more you exploit, the more detached you become and the more comfortable it is to do it even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&#39;s not just a problem for the super rich. It is a temptation for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, in many cases, for those super rich to profit off the work of others, they need the rest of us to operate off a similar mindset. We get a lot of effort and money thrown at us to try to suck us farther into that destructive loop, to try to convince us that we need to play that same game of climbing over others to get to the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will get the politicians and the thinktanks pushing narratives that we need to be afraid of anybody who is different than us. We are reassured that it is okay, probably even good, to hurt those others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll get a lot of advertising telling us how we are not complete if we don&#39;t pursue having more power and wealth for ourselves. Those ads will even be personalized now, using a couple decades of mining everything we do online for data to make sure those ads hit as close as possible to our deepest insecurities. If you just buy this, your life will be better. Don&#39;t slow down enough to consider that it means you&#39;d have less to share generously with those that really need it. Don&#39;t even think about those things that probably should be a higher priority for yourself. Sabbath is one act of resistance to this, but I&#39;ll briefly put on my tech person hat to say: so is installing an ad blocker on your devices. Seriously, do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the concept of rest itself can get hijacked to further the push for more productivity. Some of the smarter managers will say that if you need a break, that is allowed within reason, but primarily so that you can be more productive later. We need rest because that&#39;s actually how we get the most done in the long run. This argument goes all the way back to Aristotle. It&#39;s also scientifically true; that is how we get the most done in the long run. But I think that argument comes up short of the picture of Sabbath being painted here. That&#39;s still the Pharaoh mindset that we exist primarily for production, just with an extra little note about how to optimize that production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham Joshua Heschel in his classic work on the Sabbath said the same. Heschel argues that &amp;quot;to the biblical mind, however, labor is the means toward an end, and the Sabbath as a day of rest, as a day of abstaining from toil, is not for the purpose of recovering one&#39;s lost strength and becoming fit for the forthcoming labor. The Sabbath is a day for the sake of life.&amp;quot; The biblical framing of the Sabbath flips the more productivity version completely on its head. We don&#39;t observe Sabbath for the sake of being more productive. We are productive for the sake of being able to observe Sabbath, where we have a chance to resonate with our true humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as Pharaoh tried to cut away the humanity of the Israelites, there are a lot of pressures on us to strip away our own humanity. We are constantly encouraged, in ways both subtle and sometimes obvious, to just be good producers and consumers. Like Pharaoh said, we are supposed to work so hard that it&#39;s all we can do, and we can&#39;t focus on ideas like a God who loves us just as we are and wants to liberate us from oppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;jesus-on-resisting-scarcity&quot;&gt;Jesus on Resisting Scarcity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus offered some wisdom about trying to reclaim some humanity in the face of this destructive cycle as well, including in the Matthew 6 text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says instead of scarcity and a need to constantly push for more at the expense of others, God offers abundance. God provides enough for the birds of the air, the grass, the lilies, and will do the same for you. It&#39;s a reaffirmation of the creation poem&#39;s claim that God made the world very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one sense, this is very simple and straightforward. There are two opposite things. One of them is destructive. The other affirms our humanity and the humanity of others around us. Pick the good one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I think that the Bible&#39;s language makes stuff like this sound too straightforward. Similarly, in a lot of churches, one of the common baptismal vows is something about renouncing Satan and all his works. Sometimes I think there&#39;s not enough nuance about good and evil and the complexities of the world in that kind of language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are times where I hear the latest update on the authoritarian police state conducting kidnappings, torture, murder, and the dismantling of every human right we hold dear. Then I see resistance to this reality, like when thousands of people are out in -26*C Minneapolis weather. In one location about 100 clergy were simply kneeling and praying out in the freezing cold, until they got arrested. Moments like that make me think that sometimes it really can be that clear what it looks like to renounce Satan and all his works. We need the nuance and certainly the love for enemies when we&#39;re talking about specific people caught up in those evil systems, and we did see some of that, too, like the story of the woman who saved the life of the ICE agent who had arrested her. But we need unashamed clarity in renouncing those evil systems, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sabbath is one of our tools to do that renouncing. There&#39;s a good argument that Friday&#39;s general strike and protests in Minneapolis was the best embodiment of this component of Sabbath I have ever seen. They chose to sacrifice work productivity and at least a chance at some comfort inside, to reclaim their humanity and the humanity of those being attacked the most. They chose to set aside all the reasons why they could have opted out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That shows it isn&#39;t a simple &amp;quot;just choose better.&amp;quot; That must have been really hard. I had a hard enough time walking from the bus stop to work on Friday after I missed a transfer, and it wasn&#39;t even as cold here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s also slow work. It won&#39;t always look like progress immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one essential component of what makes all that really hard and slow work possible is that they did it together. At minimum you&#39;re going to need to be able to fight that battle against the fear and scarcity thinking alongside others trying to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sabbath and &amp;quot;church&amp;quot; are not strictly the same thing. They&#39;re not even the same day of the week. Plus, for a church like ours that relies on a lot of volunteers every week, often it doesn&#39;t even feel like the usual definition of rest. Marlene touched on this well last week, including doing a good job challenging that maybe we need to expand our concept of rest. But like Sabbath, what church can do is remind us of a few important ideas like that a creative God loves us just as we are and provides enough for us. It can also sometimes get very practical helping each other with questions like budgets and how to align those to our real values. Or from me as a tech guy, it might be helping you with things like using an ad blocker or finding alternatives to relying on US Big Tech companies. I&#39;ve spent a lot of time recently thinking about that last one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not always get it right. You will not always get it right. We as a collective will not always get it right. Sometimes we will hurt ourselves or others when we fall into those traps of fear and scarcity. Sometimes we&#39;ll find ourselves going along with an oppressive system because it is those other people who we barely think of as humans being hurt, not our people. Sometimes we will forget the way of Sabbath and fall back into the way of Pharaoh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-sabbath-as-resistance&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Sabbath as Resistance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When that happens, we are lovingly invited back into Sabbath again and into community again. We are invited back toward a God that loves us in all our messy and sometimes unproductive humanity. There&#39;s a reason why Sabbath is a weekly discipline, not a one-time miracle fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still need those regular reminders as much as ever. Those temptations are realities of our world today just as much as they were at the time the laws about Sabbath were being handed down. If anything, it all seems to be going faster by the year. The world often demands that we &amp;quot;move fast and break things&amp;quot; to reference an old Facebook mantra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the face of these realities, Sabbath becomes an act of resistance. It is a way of saying &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; to those things that we desperately need to say no to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sabbath can remind us of the slower but much more important work of being human together. Maybe instead of moving fast and breaking things, the way of God often looks a lot more like moving slow and fixing things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;deleted-scenes&quot;&gt;Deleted Scenes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were segments that got cut for time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-shabbos-goy-approach&quot;&gt;The Shabbos Goy Approach&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is related to the idea about Sabbath being for everyone, not just the observant Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises one of the first questions for me. If like in the Exodus text, Sabbath is ONLY about worshipping God, then why would it apply to animals? Animals don&#39;t worship the Israelite God or any other god as far as we know. Even most immigrants are probably not worshipping the Israelite God. They don&#39;t care that the Israelite creation poem says a god they don&#39;t believe in rested on that day. If the purpose of the Sabbath is for the faithful worshippers to devote their time to their God, it would honestly make more sense that it would be a perfect chance to let the animals and the immigrants and the servants pick up the slack while you&#39;re doing your worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know some modern versions of Judaism do take this approach. There are many things they will not do on the Sabbath but if a Gentile is visiting, the Gentile can do it for them. There&#39;s even a term for it, the Shabbos goy, or Sabbath Gentile. That does best fit our postmodern sensibilities, too, where we generally believe that just because we believe a practice applies to us from our religious tradition doesn&#39;t mean that we should apply it to others.
But that is missing one of the big components that is conveyed more by the Deuteronomy text…
Categories of Actions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea was in place in a few different spots of the sermon before being cut entirely, but I had wanted to expand on the place of being able to say &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; to things.
A while ago I was listening to an audiobook about the climate crisis. I don&#39;t even remember the name of the book unfortunately, but there one thing that came up that really stuck with me. It was the idea that there are a few different ways of working toward making the world a little bit better, about climate or about lots of other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reform: working within existing systems to help mitigate the damage. You might think of that as some of our better politicians or public servants helping prepare policy, for example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Healing or charity: helping restore those who have already been hurt by whatever harmful system we&#39;re talking about. Lots of non-profits will fall in that category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct resistance: naming the evil thing that is happening, drawing attention to it so others are aware, including those who might be unknowingly participating in it or who do sort of know but find ways to rationalize it to themselves. You can think of protests or petitions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building an alternative: showing that a better way of being is possible and inviting people into it. In that climate category it might be something like a solar energy coop, showing that you don&#39;t need to invest in fossil fuels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, we don&#39;t need to all do all of them all of the time. It&#39;s too much. You&#39;re not going to do it all well. We probably mostly need to pick one or two areas that we really care about and can do some good in, find some community that is working on doing that on an ongoing basis, and really invest some focused energy on that. That&#39;s a lot more effective than constantly bouncing around between whatever is trending on social media that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my general experience in Mennonite or other Anabaptist churches is that we like a lot of the building an alternative category, other than maybe not always being so good at inviting others into it. And we have a pretty good dose of healing or charity as well, as most churches do. We mostly opt out of reform and out of direct resistance, which often comes out of wanting to maintain some separation from the ways of the world. It is generally true that I do not like to spend more time than I have to on the things that we are saying &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; to, those things that we are opposing. Especially in a sermon, I usually do see the primary function as being inviting people into that better alternative, that thing that we say yes to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My challenge in how we drew up this series is to slow down enough to spend some time unpacking what we need to resist, some of the evils that we need to say no to, allowing the more positive alternative to remain for Carrie next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;enshittification&quot;&gt;Enshittification&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This came as an expansion on the idea of the pursuit of profit sometimes being to such an extreme that it is even hurting the users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cory Doctorow has coined the term enshittification. If you&#39;d prefer, you can call it crapification or platform decay. It was initially meant to describe specifically how technology platforms decline over time. First, the vendors creating the platform are focused on making things good for users. Then they might shift to prioritizing business customers, the ones who are actually giving them money, like the advertisers who are buying all that user data for ad slots. Then they&#39;ll go one step further, which is to prioritize short-term value for shareholders, which often means doing things that are actively hostile to both the end users and the businesses. They can get away with it because most of these platforms are very closed with a strong network effect and high switching costs. You can&#39;t just leave Facebook and take all your contacts with you. That is on purpose; Facebook designed it that way. So you stay, even if you can consciously say that you think it is doing you more harm than good. Doctorow&#39;s original meaning for it was a little more precise to this platform decay process, but as language often does, it has since taken on a life of its own to be more generally any time a company decides to screw over their customers to make a little more profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could talk more about how to resist this in terms of technology design, using the work of Doctorow and others, but for the sake of this sermon, I&#39;m going to simply note that this is a modern version of the scarcity mindset much like we saw with Pharaoh. Even when we are talking about companies with market cap valuations in the trillions of dollars and maybe a couple hundred billion on the balance sheet, they will still try to squeeze in one more ad, or charge a couple percent more in fees, in order to always get a little bit more and it will always be at the expense of everybody else. They are in this same cycle, constantly demanding more and more power. They never see it as enough. All they can do is keep going, making it worse and worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;consumerism&quot;&gt;Consumerism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flip side of the demand to always be more productive is that even when we rest, it should be primarily spent consuming instead. Marlene&#39;s work in the previous message about rest did not make this idea less necessary to include, as she discussed how rest really means relationships, not just sitting on a couch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do take that break, we hear the message that you better at least be using it to consume the production of others. A lot of what our culture now considers rest are things like watching TV. I like TV. I think there&#39;s a lot of good things that happen in that medium of storytelling. But sometimes it feels like it&#39;s just another chore, trying to keep up with the infinite supply of streaming services, and a lot of the time it might be a nice break but it&#39;s usually not any kind of reclaiming my humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;heschel&quot;&gt;Heschel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a quote from the very first page of Heschel&#39;s work on the Sabbath that I found incredible, but it was too long to try to quote it all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical civilization is man&#39;s conquest of space. It is a triumph frequently achieved by sacrificing an essential ingredient of existence, namely, time. In technical civilization, we expend time to gain space. To enhance our power in the world of space is our main objective. Yet to have more does not mean to be more. The power we attain in the world of space terminates abruptly at the borderline of time. But time is the heart of existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To gain control of the world of space is certainly one of our tasks. The danger begins when in gaining power in the realm of space we forfeit all aspirations in the realm of time. There is a realm of time where the goal is not to have but to be, not to own but to give, not to control but to share, not to subdue but to be in accord. Life goes wrong when the control of space, the acquisition of things of space, becomes our sole concern.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is more useful than power, nothing more frightful. We have often suffered from degradation by poverty, now we are threatened with degradation through power. There is happiness in the love of labor, there is misery in the love of gain. Many hearts and pitchers are broken at the fountain of profit. Selling himself into slavery to things, man becomes a utensil that is broken at the fountain.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;responsibility-and-rest&quot;&gt;Responsibility and Rest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was briefly going to spend more time tackling how the words of Jesus in Matthew 6 can be abused. That included dismissing mental health concerns – clinical anxiety is not the same thing as being stuck in the destructive scarcity loop - but also included a note on maintaining a sense of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words of Jesus are not about denying responsibility to care for yourself and others in the ways that you can. I think Abraham Joshua Heschel in his classic work on The Sabbath expresses some of this tension well and was along the same lines as Jesus in Matthew 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our intention here is not to deprecate the world of space. To disparage space and the blessing of things of space, is to disparage the works of creation, the works which God beheld and saw &amp;quot;it was good.&amp;quot;… What we plead against is man&#39;s unconditional surrender to space, his enslavement to things. We must not forget that it is not a thing that lends significance to a moment; it is a moment that lends significance to things.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adult Ed - Luke Birth Narratives</title>
    <link href="https://theology.ryanrobinson.ca/2025/manger-misunderstanding/" />
    <updated>2025-11-30T11:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://theology.ryanrobinson.ca/2025/manger-misunderstanding/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the first week of Advent, I led our church&#39;s Adult Education hour with a look at the birth narratives in Luke. Below is an adapted version of my notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll start by noting that I am adapting most of this from &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebiblefornormalpeople.com/classes/a-manger-misunderstanding/&quot;&gt;a course with Pete Enns in the Bible for Normal People network called A Manger Misunderstanding&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s only available with the paid subscription called The Society of Normal People. The network&#39;s name comes from that it really tries to be accessible to anybody. Pete and the others in the Bible for Normal People are good at getting serious scholarship across in very friendly ways. That&#39;s my plug for them to acknowledge that that&#39;s where most of the content for today came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I basically listened through his presentation that was about an hour plus Q&amp;amp;A time and tried to shrink that into about half an hour, put it into my own voice a little more, added a little room for it to be more interactive, and added a couple of other tangents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;comparing-the-gospels&quot;&gt;Comparing the Gospels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Pete points out some of the differences between the Gospels. Matthew and Luke are the two Gospels that have birth narratives in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew primarily presents Jesus as the new Moses. There&#39;s the story of Herod massacring the innocent children, mirroring what Pharoah did around the birth of Moses. There&#39;s a story of escaping Egypt. That emphasis continues a lot throughout Matthew, commonly accepted as the most Jewish Gospel, where Jesus is largely presented as a new revelation or new law or new wisdom (as I heard Diana Butler Bass say recently, not just a wisdom teacher but wisdom itself) within the Jewish story. All the Gospel writers are Jewish, writing about a Jewish Jesus, but Matthew leans in the hardest with the parallels to other figures from Jewish history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke on the other hand puts more emphasis on Jesus as the true Caesar. The birth narratives, and the Gospel as a whole, are a lot more concerned with how this Jesus movement interacts within the wider Roman Empire political moment. Jesus is a new king with a completely different kind of kingdom compared to Caesar. It is Luke that we are focusing on today, so we&#39;ll see a lot of this theme of kingship, which was teased nicely for me last week with some Christ the King Sunday comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;narrative-1-gabriels-announcement-to-mary&quot;&gt;Narrative 1: Gabriel&#39;s Announcement to Mary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the first text, from Luke 1:30-35 (NRSVUE):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30 The angel said to her, &amp;quot;Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. 31 And now, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you will name him Jesus. 32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his ancestor David. 33 He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.&amp;quot; 34 Mary said to the angel, &amp;quot;How can this be, since I am a virgin?&amp;quot; 35 The angel said to her, &amp;quot;The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be holy; he will be called Son of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had someone else read it out loud once. Then I&#39;m going to give you about a couple minutes to read it again and think about it. Sometimes we need to read slowly to really notice things, especially if you are familiar with the story. I want you to think about what phrases stand out to you. Maybe you&#39;ve never noticed them before. Maybe you have heard a lot about them in the past. What do you think they mean? What do you think that Luke is trying to get across by including them? And I want to give enough time for my fellow introverts to really have a chance to think about it before you start sharing with the rest of the group, so after it was read out once, I waited a couple minutes of silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then took any comments about what stood out to them. Interestingly, the answers were mostly not what Pete Enns drew attention to. Instead, the main theme that emerged was the one of fear, with Mary being told not to be afraid, and even the language of &amp;quot;overshadow&amp;quot; which is not the most friendly term to Mary&#39;s agency (at least in this English translation). Even though that is not what Pete was looking at, I did think it was an interesting complementary theme, because the instinct with all this king language is to assume a dominating powerful God. Luke goes on to subvert that assumption, but there&#39;s a good start by pointing out that the real God is not one who needs to be feared in that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete points out 6 phrases, with 2 slight variations on 3 themes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Son of the Most High&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Son of God.&amp;quot; We&#39;ve got one theme of the connection between Jesus and God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Throne of his ancestor David&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;House of Jacob.&amp;quot; We&#39;ve got a connection to one of the patriarchs and the most famous king, anchored in the Jewish story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Forever&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;no end.&amp;quot; We&#39;ve got the idea that this is a permanent promise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some of you, this might already be confusing, so I&#39;m going to backtrack and give a really big overview of the history of Israel up to this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the history of the Israelites in the Bible they are subject to some powerful Empire or another – Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Greece, and now Rome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are really two exceptions to this. The big one is after Egypt, when they have returned to the land and have political sovereignty. This peaks with David and his son Solomon, then declines from there until they are right back until control of another Empire. David and Solomon is the golden era. This is what they are most nostalgic for. A lot of their prophetic literature is about restoring that kind of Golden Age when they had sovereignty, free of imperial oppression, with their own king again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other period they were free from imperial rule was a brief but more recent one. They successfully got free of the Greek Empire under the leadership of the Maccabees, but it didn&#39;t last long. Some of this period is in those books that are in Catholic and Orthodox Bibles but not in Protestant ones. When some of the prophetic literature of this time is saying that they will have a king of Israel again forever, I imagine that they are thinking of that recent glimpse of freedom that didn&#39;t last long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That ties in the &amp;quot;forever&amp;quot; and the King David connections. What about the other one, the connection to God? Pete shows some parallels in other texts where kings are called things like &amp;quot;Son of God&amp;quot; and told that their reign will be forever. This text in Luke is echoing a lot of that language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, over Christian history, the language of &amp;quot;son of God&amp;quot; also came to mean that Jesus is a part of God, one of the three persons of the Trinity. There are other texts that make a stronger case for that, but that&#39;s not the main point here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That kind of language here was simply something you would say to identify a king, and the rest of this text is very clearly aligning Jesus as a king a lot like David, a political leader over a free Israel, forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;narrative-2-prophecy-of-zechariah&quot;&gt;Narrative 2: Prophecy of Zechariah&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next story is the prophecy to Zechariah, from Luke 1:67-79:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;67 Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:
68 &amp;quot;Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,
for he has looked favorably on his people and redeemed them.
69 He has raised up a mighty savior for us
in the house of his child David,
70 as he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from of old,
71 that we would be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us.
72 Thus he has shown the mercy promised to our ancestors
and has remembered his holy covenant,
73 the oath that he swore to our ancestor Abraham,
to grant us
74 that we, being rescued from the hands of our enemies,
might serve him without fear, 75 in holiness and righteousness
in his presence all our days.
76 And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High,
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,
77 to give his people knowledge of salvation
by the forgiveness of their sins.
78 Because of the tender mercy of our God,
the dawn from on high will break upon us,
79 to shine upon those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,
to guide our feet into the way of peace.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I again had it read out loud once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My questions for this one: First, what phrases are naming a problem? What phrases are naming a solution that God is going to do about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s how Pete summarized it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem: their enemies rule over them, including wielding the power of death against them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What God is going to do about it: looking favorably on them and remembering them to bring salvation, mercy, forgiveness, light, and peace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like &amp;quot;Son of God,&amp;quot; a lot of the language here has come to mean different things over centuries of Christian history. A lot of these things that God is doing often gets used now as salvation from sin so we can all go to Heaven when we die. Like &amp;quot;Son of God,&amp;quot; I&#39;m not refuting all those ideas also being true and there are other texts that support them better. In this text, though, remember the other half that Pete is identifying: the problem here is that Israel has enemies. They are under Roman occupation. These solutions wouldn&#39;t help with that problem if we were only talking about what God is going to do after we&#39;ve died. Zechariah&#39;s prophecy, as relayed by Luke, suggests that Jesus will free them from that occupation. Even the forgiveness of sins language in that context would be understand as a communal forgiveness, cleansing the community so that they are holy when God does send the promised king. Those ideas go together. It isn&#39;t some separate &amp;quot;and also you can go to Heaven.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the point again: Jesus is the real king, but more than the first text, we start to see how this means there is a conflict with Rome. If Jesus is the king, Caesar is not. So far, this is becoming more threatening to Rome but it is still completely normal for Jewish writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;narrative-3-angels-and-shepherds&quot;&gt;Narrative 3: Angels and Shepherds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the text that is probably the most familiar to you, because it is often in Christmas pageants, and a lot of it are themes that we&#39;ve already touched on. But here it is again, from Luke 2:8-15:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 Now in that same region there were shepherds living in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. 9 Then an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. 10 But the angel said to them, &amp;quot;Do not be afraid, for see, I am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people: 11 to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is the Messiah, the Lord. 12 This will be a sign for you: you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger.&amp;quot; 13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying,
14 &amp;quot;Glory to God in the highest heaven,
and on earth peace among those whom he favors!&amp;quot;
15 When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, &amp;quot;Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, which the Lord has made known to us.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of interesting things here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, there is ambiguity in &amp;quot;all the people&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;among those whom he favors.&amp;quot; Who does that mean? Does that mean all the Jewish people, or the entire world, or Christians that don&#39;t exist yet, or some other subset of humanity? Pete suggests that it is intentionally ambiguous so that it would feel familiar to Jewish readers thinking that is obviously about them. But it is ambiguous enough that it also teases that over the course of the Gospel, as well as Acts written by Luke as well, we will see a lot more opening up that it is really means everybody. Luke is starting from Jewish expectations and Jewish prophetic language of kingship but pushing them in a more inclusive direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting phrase here is &amp;quot;Heavenly host&amp;quot; which is militaristic language, but then they proclaim peace. I think this leads into what Pete brings up next, the Priene Calendar Inscription:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providence [a god], which has ordered all things and is deeply interested in our life, has set in most perfect order by giving us Augustus, whom she filled with virtue that he might benefit humankind, sending him as a SAVIOR both for us and for our descendants, that he might end war and arrange all things. He, Caesar, by his appearance (excelled even our anticipations), surpassing all previous benefactors, and not even leaving to posterity any hope of surpassing what he has done. The birthday of the god Augustus was the beginning of the good tidings for the world that came by reason of him which Asia resolved in Smyrna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is from not long before Jesus&#39; birth, about 9 BCE. You might recognize some of this language from the other text that we just read. It has a lot of the same things to say, but it is about Caesar being a saviour sent by a god, who would bring peace and good tidings for the world, for all time. It doesn&#39;t say it in here, but the audience knows that how Caesar does that is through conquest, through bringing everything under the control of the Empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This text with the Shepherds then, is also building on the conflict between Jesus and Caesar. Rome says these things about Caesar, but Jewish people know that Caesar&#39;s definition of peace is oppression for them. On the other hand, Luke says it is actually true about Jesus. Luke is saying that Jesus is the true ruler of everything, not Caesar. In addition to the conflict with Caesar, we&#39;re starting to see here that it might apply to more than just Israel. Caesar didn&#39;t rule over just Israel; he ruled over the entire known world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;narrative-4-anna-and-simeon&quot;&gt;Narrative 4: Anna and Simeon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one I ended up having to cut for time, but I&#39;ll still share my notes here. The text is from Luke 2:25-33, 36-38:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25 Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; this man was righteous and devout, looking forward to the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit rested on him. 26 It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord&#39;s Messiah. 27 Guided by the Spirit, Simeon came into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what was customary under the law, 28 Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying,
29 &amp;quot;Master, now you are dismissing your servant in peace,
according to your word,
30 for my eyes have seen your salvation,
31 which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,
32 a light for revelation to the gentiles
and for glory to your people Israel.&amp;quot;
33 And the child&#39;s father and mother were amazed at what was being said about him.
36 There was also a prophet, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was of a great age, having lived with her husband seven years after her marriage, 37 then as a widow to the age of eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshiped there with fasting and prayer night and day. 38 At that moment she came and began to praise God and to speak about the child to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some key things that Pete points out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is this language of &amp;quot;consolation of Israel.&amp;quot; It is used previously in the Bible, like so many of the other phrases we&#39;ve been looking. In this case, it means the end of the Babylonian Exile and the return to the land of Israel. That seems like a generic comforting phrase to us, but in that context it would bring to mind some of their other older texts written in a previous context of returning from an exile into Empire, and they are now reading it while under the control of another Empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete cites NT Wright here. Wright says that when Israel went into exile, they lost 3 major things: their land, their temple, and their king. When they came back, they got the land back, then they built a new temple, but a few hundred years later and they still have not gotten their king back. That&#39;s the messianic hope, to bring back the good old days of having a king again. They haven&#39;t really had the full consolation – the full return from Exile - until that king is in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word &amp;quot;Messiah&amp;quot; is also used here. That simply means &amp;quot;anointed one.&amp;quot; The Greek equivalent is Christ. It&#39;s not a unique term for Jesus, though. It was used for people who were anointed for many reasons, including most notably kings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there is a bit in here that is like the &amp;quot;all people&amp;quot; ambiguity that was in the previous text. See that bit about the light for revelation to the Gentiles? That seems to be echoing Isaiah 49:6, which is talking about the return from Exile. Pete argues that in Isaiah this probably meant that there will be a light to find the missing Israelites who had dispersed into the other nations as part of the Exile, not saying the other nations were to be saved as well. Here, Luke&#39;s quoting it is still ambiguous enough that it could go either way. But Luke quotes it again later in Acts and there he explicitly uses it to mean that Gentiles are included in the salvation. But as of this point in the birth narrative, it seems like more intentional ambiguity, where Jewish readers would think it means one thing but then over the course of the story it expands into a much bigger thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anna&#39;s prophecy is similar but with the language of redemption instead of consolation. That also invokes the language of coming back from Exile in some older texts. The Exile would finally come to a true end with a real king and Luke is arguing that Jesus is that true king, not Caesar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;lukes-big-point&quot;&gt;Luke&#39;s Big Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big point here is that up to this point of Luke&#39;s telling, and remember this is just the introduction to the Gospel, all of this makes complete sense within a first century Jewish framework. There&#39;s a lot of invoking that Jesus is the true king, not Caesar. Jesus will finally free them from Exile, from imperial domination, by reestablishing sovereignty with their own king chosen by God. There are a couple little hints that a big twist is coming, with some of the language about all people and intentionally invoking language used for Caesar who ruled over the whole known world, not just the Jewish part of it. Otherwise, this is all expected for first century Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to go back to a different Hebrew Bible story. In 1 Samuel 8, it is the people who demand a king from God, via the prophet Samuel. God says, no, trust me, you really don&#39;t want a king. Kings will tax you heavily and make your children slaves to make themselves richer. It won&#39;t be good for you, and you&#39;ll end up crying out to God for liberation. The people say they want a king anyway, because they want to be like other nations who have kings that go out and fight battles against other nations. They want that imperial framework of somebody ruling over them and trying to expand territory by exploiting others. God gives in and they get their kings. Guess what? The way of kings and empires didn&#39;t work out well for them, and most of the rest of the Hebrew Bible is the people calling out for liberation from one of the other Empires that took over. But even then, a lot of that calling out for help was still in the language of wanting another king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I think is fascinating here when we get to the Jesus part of the story is that God essentially says &amp;quot;fine, here&#39;s your new king. All that prophetic language, all that hope about having somebody to free them from Roman occupation, I&#39;m about to fulfill it... But I&#39;m going to do it in a completely different way than you expect.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why you get some who are frustrated with Jesus in later stories, like Judas Iscariot giving up and betraying him, because Jesus is walking around talking about loving Roman enemies instead of starting the war to free Israel from them. They have a lot of expectations for this Messianic king who would save them, and for the most part in these birth narrative texts, Luke is leaning into those expectations. One member of our congregation is a novel writer, and she pointed out in our conversation that it&#39;s a common tactic to start a story by establishing something relatable to the audience. Once they&#39;ve entered into the story, then you can start to push them in new directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are big twists coming in the story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus has no interest in the political Jerusalem throne. A couple chapters later in Luke 4, Luke even has Satan offering the thrones of the world to Jesus and Jesus rejects it. A lot of readers at that time would probably be confused, because we just had all this build up about how Jesus is supposed to be the King of Israel. Now Luke says that the way that the world does kingship is actually Satan and Jesus is doing something completely different. Right after that, Jesus says he is there to proclaim good news to the poor, freedom for prisoners, sight for the blind. That&#39;s not the stuff kings like Caesar and Herod do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That big twist continues throughout the story. Jesus&#39; version of kingship includes crucifixion. That&#39;s death at the hands of the evil Empire that he is supposed to be overthrowing. Luke has been telling us repeatedly in these birth narratives that Caesar is not the true king, that Jesus is. And then an agent of Caesar kills Jesus, in the most brutal and shameful way possible. By the normal ways of thinking about the world, that would definitely suggest that Caesar won this battle of kings; he&#39;s the one with all the armies and still alive. But then there&#39;s resurrection, which says that even though Caesar can wield death, God has the final word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke intentionally builds up that Jesus is the promised king, the real Caesar. But then he completely flips what that means. Jesus&#39; kingship is an upside-down kind of power, one that sacrifices for others and calls everyone, even enemies, into a way of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;should-we-use-the-language-of-king&quot;&gt;Should We Use the Language of King?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was something said last week for Christ the King Sunday about how a lot of Mennonites don&#39;t like using the language of Jesus as king because the language of king implies a lot of that power ruling over and exploiting others that we reject specifically because Jesus shows us a better way of being. So, I&#39;m going to open this up again to all of you: what do we do with all this king language in 2025 Canada, in a very different context? Do we try to avoid it completely? Do we fully embrace it? Something in between?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a lot of contexts, I tend to agree that it might introduce more problems than it solves. If there isn&#39;t time to unpack the ways that Jesus completely subverts the idea of kingship the way that I just have, or that Luke does over the course of the Gospel, it is probably better to not use the language. You just end up with a lot of people making bad assumptions that Jesus is the kind of violent dominating ruler like so many human leaders past and present. Those kinds of assumptions based on the language used without any extra context is part of how you can get Christian nationalism. One thing I&#39;ve started doing a lot more is replacing &amp;quot;the Kingdom of God&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;the Way of Jesus.&amp;quot; It&#39;s simple and clear what it means, and the early church did use some similar language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my biggest counterpoint is the other side of that coin. That language is there, in the Bible a lot as well as in some hymns and other Christian works over the centuries. If we don&#39;t at least occasionally remind ourselves that this is a subversion of the idea of kingship, not an embracing of that idea, that&#39;s how we end up with things like Christian nationalism who can&#39;t see the conflict between those two words. I do think we need to be able to say, &amp;quot;no kings but Jesus,&amp;quot; meaning that we reject the ways of violent dominating empire because we have accepted the way of Jesus instead. If you&#39;ve completely rejected the language entirely, there&#39;s no opportunity to do that subversion, to draw attention to that contrast, and that is a contrast that we really need to be able to name one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meanings of Sabbath</title>
    <link href="https://theology.ryanrobinson.ca/2025/meanings-sabbath/" />
    <updated>2025-11-22T10:30:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://theology.ryanrobinson.ca/2025/meanings-sabbath/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our church is planning a sermon series on Sabbath. We have a very democratic preaching approach, where speakers are largely free to take their message in whatever direction they want. This is no guarantee that this how the series will actually go at our church, but I figured since I sketched out one particular flow of the idea, I would turn that into a post here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;week-1-sabbath-as-worship&quot;&gt;Week 1: Sabbath as Worship&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sabbath reminds us of the character of God, which I tend to argue is the most important theological question at the basis of everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are a couple possible texts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Exodus 20:8-11:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 “Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. 9 Six days you shall labor and do all your work, 10 but the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns. 11 For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And from Genesis 1:31-2:3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;31 God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day. 2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array. 2 By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work. 3 Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sabbath is to be observed because God made everything in 6 days and then rested, making the 7th day holy. This is a God who is immensely creative, but it’s not perpetual productivity for the sake of constant growth. This is a God who gets to the point of supporting relationship with humans and says &amp;quot;ok, that’s very good, time to rest&amp;quot; (even though presumably God does not need rest in the way that humans do). So, the Sabbath is to remember the presence of that kind of loving God who created a very good world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;week-2-sabbath-as-rest&quot;&gt;Week 2: Sabbath as Rest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is a God who rests and who prioritizes relationship with us, that God also cares about our wellbeing including the need for regular rest. One text I noted for that idea was Matthew 11:28-12:14:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;28 “Come to me, all you who are struggling hard and carrying heavy loads, and I will give you rest. 29 Put on my yoke, and learn from me. I’m gentle and humble. And you will find rest for yourselves. 30 My yoke is easy to bear, and my burden is light.”
12:1 At that time Jesus went through the wheat fields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry so they were picking heads of wheat and eating them. 2 When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, “Look, your disciples are breaking the Sabbath law.”
3 But he said to them, “Haven’t you read what David did when he and those with him were hungry? 4 He went into God’s house and broke the law by eating the bread of the presence, which only the priests were allowed to eat. 5 Or haven’t you read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple treat the Sabbath as any other day and are still innocent? 6 But I tell you that something greater than the temple is here. 7 If you had known what this means, I want mercy and not sacrifice,[a] you wouldn’t have condemned the innocent. 8 The Human One is Lord of the Sabbath.”
Healing on the Sabbath
9 Jesus left that place and went into their synagogue. 10 A man with a withered hand was there. Wanting to bring charges against Jesus, they asked, “Does the Law allow a person to heal on the Sabbath?”
11 Jesus replied, “Who among you has a sheep that falls into a pit on the Sabbath and will not take hold of it and pull it out? 12 How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! So the Law allows a person to do what is good on the Sabbath.” 13 Then Jesus said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” So he did and it was made healthy, just like the other one. 14 The Pharisees went out and met in order to find a way to destroy Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus says that his yoke is light. That doesn&#39;t mean that following the Way of Jesus is easy, but within this context of those being crushed by the world, his way will bring them rest. That transitions into one of a few stories of healing on the Sabbath and Jesus justifying that as because human lives are worth saving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the Sabbath is a reminder of our worth. We need to take care of ourselves, including regular rest, but we also shouldn&#39;t ever feel like we are not good enough to have earned a rest. Our worth is simply in our humanity, not in being high enough up the societal scale of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;week-3-sabbath-as-resistance&quot;&gt;Week 3: Sabbath as Resistance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This builds on that, and the one I will be preaching. In the Exodus versions of the Ten Commandments I noted above in week 1, it is clear that the Sabbath is also to be observed right down to slaves, animals, and immigrants living among them. That’s the radical part of it; the powerful can always rest because they can just make others do the work for them. That&#39;s true in the the Deuteronomy version of the Ten Commandments as well, but it also changes one other important thing. It gives a different reason why to observe the Sabbath: remember you were a slave in Egypt and God brought you out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 Keep the Sabbath day and treat it as holy, exactly as the Lord your God commanded: 13 Six days you may work and do all your tasks, 14 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. Don’t do any work on it—not you, your sons or daughters, your male or female servants, your oxen or donkeys or any of your animals, or the immigrant who is living among you—so that your male and female servants can rest just like you. 15 Remember that you were a slave in Egypt, but the Lord your God brought you out of there with a strong hand and an outstretched arm. That’s why the Lord your God commands you to keep the Sabbath day. (Deuteronomy 5:12-15 CEB)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This newly freed people aren’t allowed to just turn around and repeat the same injustices on others now that they have some freedom. So, the Sabbath is a reminder not to fall into the trap of constantly trying to increase our power and wealth, pushing others down along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;week-4-sabbath-as-liberation&quot;&gt;Week 4: Sabbath as Liberation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final week is the other side of the resistance coin. If Sabbath as resistance reminds us of what to say no to, what do we say yes to instead? One possible text is Luke 13:10-17:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath. 11 A woman was there who had been disabled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and couldn’t stand up straight. 12 When he saw her, Jesus called her to him and said, “Woman, you are set free from your sickness.” 13 He placed his hands on her and she straightened up at once and praised God.
14 The synagogue leader, incensed that Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, responded, “There are six days during which work is permitted. Come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath day.”
15 The Lord replied, “Hypocrites! Don’t each of you on the Sabbath untie your ox or donkey from its stall and lead it out to get a drink? 16 Then isn’t it necessary that this woman, a daughter of Abraham, bound by Satan for eighteen long years, be set free from her bondage on the Sabbath day?” 17 When he said these things, all his opponents were put to shame, but all those in the crowd rejoiced at all the extraordinary things he was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: I&#39;ve now realized that part of this overlaps with the Matthew text I put in week 2, so one of them would likely need to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noted that text when &lt;a href=&quot;https://dianabutlerbass.substack.com/p/sunday-musings-d8e&quot;&gt;Diana Butler Bass had a good post about it recently&lt;/a&gt; when it came up in the lectionary. There are probably a few other Jesus healing on the Sabbath stories that would work just as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is: most of the healing stories are not just curing physical ailments; they also provide social liberation to be reintegrated into community. I know some disability theology people do some good work on that distinction as well, emphasizing wanting to be treated as an equal member of the community whether or not the disability ever is &amp;quot;cured.&amp;quot; If we interpret Sabbath purely as &amp;quot;rest no matter what&amp;quot; then it is easy to turn that into a rule that stops you from doing that kind of liberation, but Jesus clearly took the side that liberating on the Sabbath is good and more in line with the real purpose. So, Sabbath is a reminder to imagine and work toward a more just world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tangent-types-of-justice-work&quot;&gt;Tangent: Types of Justice Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process reminded me of another thing I encountered a while ago. I wish I remember the source, but I didn&#39;t take a note of it. It was in some book about the climate emergency. There was a point in there that brought up that there are (at least) four different categories of how we do work in the face of this emergency, and I think it is generally true of a lot of social issues. This is how I remembered them, which may or may not be entirely accurate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reform: limiting the damage, working within existing systems. This may be the work of politicians (the good ones) and activists, for example, who generally cannot overhaul everything into a utopia overnight but who can identify those ways that current systems are causing harm and enact change to eliminate or at least blunt that harm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Healing and Restoration: aiding those who have already been harmed, to restore them back into society as soon as possible. This might look like a lot of great work from charities and non-profits who often aren&#39;t fixing the problem but are making sure that those hurt by it aren&#39;t abandoned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resistance: directly calling out what is causing the harm, so people realize it is a problem that needs to be resolved. This might look like protests and petitions and calling your elected representatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternative: modelling what an alternative system could look like. This is where, in my opinion, religious and other voluntary communities can truly shine, as they can demonstrate what it is like to live differently. Without this, it is hard for people to catch a vision of what even is the point of all this hard work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these are ever sufficient on their own. For example, if we collectively only ever did reform without any others, we are limiting our imagination, allowing &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; to be hurt because at least it is less than before. If you never do any reform, it&#39;s a constant uphill battle demanding an absolutely all or nothing sudden change which is usually not realistic. Importantly, that does not mean that each one of us individually needs to do all of them. We can&#39;t. It&#39;s too much and we will end up doing most of it badly. Instead, some of us should be really good at reform, some really good at healing, some really good at resistance, some really good at building alternatives. Pick your lane and celebrate those in other lanes, not looking down on them as some form of lesser work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think about those fairly often, and I did again here, as all of those came up to some degree within the themes of what is accomplished by Sabbath well understood.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Summer Talk - Ryan and the Real Empathy Machine</title>
    <link href="https://theology.ryanrobinson.ca/2025/summer-lars-real-girl/" />
    <updated>2025-07-06T10:30:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://theology.ryanrobinson.ca/2025/summer-lars-real-girl/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I gave this short talk at my church where we don&#39;t have the full and more formal services in the summer. Instead, we have shorter talks where a different person each week answers a themed question and then there is time for discussion. This is less formal (and shorter) than a typical sermon. The question this year was about a story that helped us learn something about God, the world, or people different than yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;scripture-text&quot;&gt;Scripture Text&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%208%3A1-11&amp;amp;version=CEB&quot;&gt;John 8:1-11 (CEB)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;transcript&quot;&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The famous film critic Roger Ebert once said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all born with a certain package. We are who we are. Where we were born, who we were born as, how we were raised. We are kind of stuck inside that person, and the purpose of civilization and growth is to be able to reach out and empathize a little bit with other people, find out what makes them tick, what they care about. For me, the movies are like a machine that generates empathy. If it&#39;s a great movie, it lets you understand a little bit more about what it&#39;s like to be a different gender, a different race, a different age, a different economic class, a different nationality, a different profession, different hopes, aspirations, dreams and fears. It helps us to identify with the people who are sharing this journey with us.&amp;quot;
There&#39;s a movie podcast I listen to that references this idea often, as the &amp;quot;empathy machine&amp;quot; or the need for &amp;quot;empathetic imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&#39;t truly know what it is like to be someone else, but stories, movies or otherwise, can be a great tool to help build those empathetic imagination muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some scientific backing to this. There are a couple things we know happen when we are engaged with a story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it wraps us up in it. It allows us to forget about our experiences for a time to imagine what it is like to be somebody else. We have to get ourselves out of the way a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we do that, mirror neurons kick in. When we see somebody else doing something, our mirror neurons fire as if we are doing it. That helps create empathy understanding them, as well as allows us to learn from watching others. Studies have shown that those neurons are firing when encountering a story. It is most powerful with personal stories with somebody you already know, but it is also true in mediated stories like watching a movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined, this can give us a bigger picture of the world, setting aside my experience to imagine somebody else&#39;s. Stories can allow us to learn in ways that we wouldn&#39;t learn in a lecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;lars-and-the-real-girl&quot;&gt;Lars and the Real Girl&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the biggest example of this in my life is the movie &lt;em&gt;Lars and the Real Girl&lt;/em&gt;. If you haven&#39;t seen it, I think you should, but I will recap the main plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lars lives in the converted garage on the property with his brother Gus and sister-in-law Karin. He&#39;s very isolated and has some trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day he tells Gus and Karin that he has a girlfriend he met online, and she is coming to visit. Their excitement quickly fades when Bianca arrives and is a lifelike sex doll that Lars is treating as a human being. This could be a setup for a lot of punching down jokes at Lars&#39; expense, but the movie doesn&#39;t take that easy route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Gus and Karin are advised by a psychologist that they should play along because Lars needs this to work out some things. But they aren&#39;t the only ones who play along. The entire small-town community gets on board. It becomes a story of how the community rallies around Lars and Bianca, by entering his reality, by showing radical empathy. They start inviting Bianca to things; she joins the PTA and volunteers at the hospital and is routinely out with the community one way or another. Lars starts accepting more opportunities to be engaged in the community as well. All of this helps Lars heal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That community includes Gus and Karin, Lars&#39; coworkers, and the church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the church that gets a small but pivotal scene. Karin and Gus have gone to the church bible study group to enlist their help after hearing the advice of the psychologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation captures a tension between wanting to hold to the obvious truth of the situation and doing what is uncomfortable but might be best for Lars, at least according to the psychologist. One man compares Lars to the story of worshipping the golden calf and declares that young people these days have no willpower. I found a script online that includes a few more lines to that effect. One member of the group worries that if they play along, they are encouraging bad habits. There is a &amp;quot;shouldn&#39;t expose the children&amp;quot; line, referring to letting Bianca come to church. But then, one of the characters exclaims &amp;quot;what&#39;s the big deal&amp;quot; and starts naming things a little strange or unhealthy or maybe even harmful about family members of others in the group that they&#39;ve all been able to set aside that judgemental voice out of love for them. Many of us have been in conversations something like this at some point in our lives, dealing with that kind of tension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually they all turn to the pastor, who has been silent so far. He simply says, as the last line of the scene &amp;quot;the question is, as always, what would Jesus do?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s a line that could easily read as an empty cliché slogan. I grew up in the period when the WWJD was commoditized on bracelets and everything else. But in the context of the movie, as the final word of this serious debate, without even explicitly answering the question, it is surprisingly effective. In the next scene, Bianca is at church, and everybody is trying to play along, some better at it than others. After that there is little question about how they should be responding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first watched this as a seminary student. I was scheduled to give a short talk as part of a chapel service the following week, but it was Friday night, and I was too tired to come up with an idea. I decided to give myself a break to watch what I thought was a light-hearted comedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I got a beautiful story that provided me exactly what I needed for that chapel talk which became about the healing power of community. I actually won a cash award at the end of the year for &amp;quot;evangelism&amp;quot; which I was confused by, so I had to ask and I found out it was because of that chapel talk. That maybe tells you all you need to know about how little anybody talked about evangelism at my seminary, but I was not complaining about the cash award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, it was a breakthrough for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have many positive things to say about my church growing up, and other communities through university undergrad. Many of the people there showed the same kind of compassion we see in this movie. But the most important thing in the teaching and in the songs was a particular understanding of the story of Jesus. A starting point for that understanding was that God is out there detached from us being the perfect judge of all right and wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a lot of reasons, that image had been crumbling for me for the previous few years and I had been doing a lot of reconstructing how I saw God. From the character we see in Jesus, I started seeing a lot more a God who enters humanity, including suffering with us. We could say that is a God who shows a radical empathy. That&#39;s a wildly different starting point.
And here&#39;s the important part for the movie: when you think of God primarily as judge, detached out there, that&#39;s how you think you should be and how the church should be, too. The most important thing in any discussion is that you are clear about what is right and what is wrong. That&#39;s one half of that tension in that pivotal scene. In practice I experienced a lot of loving kind community in churches. But the concept of church was still largely talked about through the lens of learning to understand God better and to help others understand God better. It was about being right and correcting others who are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also was vaguely aware that there were other kinds of churches that seemed to be a different extreme, refusing to pass any kind of claim on truth, just being a nice social club, respectable middle-class people who already have their life perfect and would have a really hard time ever dealing with an addict or even somebody in dirty clothes coming straight from a night shift. That version didn&#39;t appeal to me either, where there didn&#39;t seem to be much substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came into watching this movie with an understanding of God that was a lot healthier, with this kind of radical incarnational empathy, but my understanding of the church hadn&#39;t caught up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This movie, and especially this scene, hit at the exact right time in my life. Suddenly I could imagine a church, or community more widely, acting with this kind of radical empathy that I had begun to be able to see in the Jesus story. I probably had heard somebody say that is what the church should be like, but I couldn&#39;t really imagine it and it was not sinking in. But now I had seen it in story form and it suddenly clicked. They don&#39;t deny reality in the pursuit of being nice above all else. They still clearly understand what&#39;s really going on. But they realize that love for Lars means setting aside that judgement and entering his reality. The goal isn&#39;t to be nice. The goal isn&#39;t to be right. The goal is to embody that radical empathy we see in Jesus that brings about real healing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Whose Armour?</title>
    <link href="https://theology.ryanrobinson.ca/2025/whose-armour/" />
    <updated>2025-03-16T10:00:00Z</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;scripture-text&quot;&gt;Scripture Text&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians%206%3A10-24&amp;amp;version=CEB&quot;&gt;Ephesians 6:10-24 (CEB)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QAIfTCdJlS8?si=oz_Wl48kiJrAnGNo&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;transcript&quot;&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve reached the end of this series on Ephesians. We&#39;ve covered some big topics like salvation, diversity in unity, new creation, and a liberatory reading of the household code that invited us into an empowered mutual servanthood. Somehow, despite some of those themes of diversity and liberation, the team we managed to assemble for this series were five white men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-call-to-fight&quot;&gt;The Call to Fight&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That does put us in positions of relative privilege, as the ones who benefit in the short-term from unjust systems. A very privileged interpretation of this text might be one that is about dominating through force or coercion, that this is about how we need to fight to establish ourselves and protect our people against those other people. It&#39;s about being tough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or at the very least, maybe it&#39;s &amp;quot;spiritual warfare&amp;quot; which for me mostly makes me think of an episode in &lt;em&gt;Xena Warrior Princess&lt;/em&gt;. Xena and Gabrielle are recruited into a battle between angels and demons and there&#39;s lots of flying around and sword fighting and it was really cool to teenage Ryan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still a strong contingent of the Christian tradition that would say things like that, even though it is hard to reconcile with Jesus. It is also hard to reconcile with this text, which quickly establishes that our battle is not against human enemies. That idea falls apart even faster within the context of the rest of the letter spending so much time talking about things like reconciliation between groups that don&#39;t get along. It&#39;s clearly not about one group needing to dominate the other. Let&#39;s quickly discard that framework, because it doesn&#39;t really deserve any more attention than that. &lt;a href=&quot;https://theology.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/cult-innocence/&quot;&gt;See a couple of sermons in the Fall&lt;/a&gt; if you do want to engage more with that topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;principalities-and-powers&quot;&gt;Principalities and Powers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this text does support the idea that we do need to be ready to fight in some sense. We don&#39;t have a battle against human enemies, but we do against what many translations put something like &amp;quot;principalities and powers.&amp;quot; My apologies to the tech team for all the plosive p&#39;s in repeating this phrase. With maybe some exceptions for the charismatic tradition, &amp;quot;principalities and powers&amp;quot; is not language that we normally use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Common English Bible translation instead unpacks that into &amp;quot;rulers, authorities, forces of cosmic darkness, and spiritual powers of evil in the heavens.&amp;quot; That&#39;s doing something interesting, because it essentially includes the two possible ways to understand who the enemies are in this battle. Rulers and authorities suggest earthly human power structures, the ways that we dominate each other. Forces of cosmic darkness and spiritual powers of evil in the heavens suggest something more supernatural. We might use a word like demons. Or it at least suggests something more abstract about our way of living in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ephesians does not say a lot directly about the nature of these powers and principalities. It&#39;s not generally something that was high priority for the original Paul or any of these other authors who wrote later in his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they do come up at a higher rate in Ephesians than anywhere else in Paul. According to Clinton Arnold in Ephesians: Power and Magic, Ephesus was seen to be a major centre for magical practice. By &amp;quot;magic&amp;quot; we mean something like: learning the correct speech and actions that allow you to control spiritual forces that would otherwise harm you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to other ancient sources, this claim by Arnold is supported by Acts 19, which describes Paul&#39;s time in Ephesus. That includes encounters with several people who practiced this kind of magic and then repented by burning all their very valuable magical texts. Acts attributes more demons to Ephesus than anywhere else in Paul&#39;s journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may be why Paul talks about these powers and principalities more in Ephesians than anywhere else. As is always true with reading these letters, they have a context with specific things the audience was thinking about and that the author was trying to address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&#39;s one half of what we saw in the CEB translation, the demon half. And there is a good argument that this is all that Paul meant here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most modern interpreters don&#39;t like reducing it to only be about that, though, for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&#39;s the modernist bias, that we often start with a presupposition that there is no evidence to believe that such demons exist. If the text is only about those, and we dismiss those, it doesn&#39;t leave us with anything else that it says.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&#39;s the practical pastoral concern that it can create a scenario of being so focused on these spiritual forces battling out there, it&#39;s easy to ignore what&#39;s happening right in front of you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The one that is most compelling to me: there are plenty of other biblical texts and extra-biblical texts from the same time and even a couple centuries earlier that suggest these two ideas can go together, not be contradictory. These often align the imagery of these spiritual forces with systemic injustices or more broadly the battle between good ways of being in relationship and bad ways of being in relationship. Even within this text, it goes on to explain that the weapons and armour for defeating these evil forces are things like truth, peace, salvation, justice, and the word of God. If it were strictly talking about evil demons, you might expect more &amp;quot;magical&amp;quot; tools like prayer, fasting, maybe some charismatic gifts which Paul isn&#39;t afraid to talk about elsewhere. Also, this text references back to Isaiah which was within a context of being conquered by a literal foreign empire and seeking liberation from that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there is good reason to believe that it is at least talking about this more abstracted battle between good and bad ways of being, the way of God and the way of the oppressive Empire. Perhaps that&#39;s in addition to literal spiritual forces, but I have a hard time believing that it only meant literal spiritual forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, there are a couple more important points here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, evil does exist. It&#39;s true that we can&#39;t neatly divide between the good people and the evil people, like a lot of Xena and other media from when I was a kid. There&#39;s a good argument that this is what the original sin, knowledge of good and evil, meant, that kind of blanket judgement of a person&#39;s value. But that doesn&#39;t deny that evil does exist within many of the ways that the world operates. If you look at the news and we&#39;re being honest, it probably won&#39;t take you that long to find something happening that you want to describe as evil. We know that evil exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;gods-victory&quot;&gt;God&#39;s Victory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase something from G.K. Chesterton, which I believe I first encountered through Rachel Held Evans: the reason we tell fairytales is not to teach children that dragons exist. Children know soon enough that dragons exist, that the world can be scary, that evil happens. The reason we tell fairytales is to teach children that the dragons can be defeated. That&#39;s a big part of what I think is happening here in Ephesians. They knew the evil existed; what they needed to know was that it could be defeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recipients of the letter were told they didn&#39;t need to be afraid of these evil powers anymore. They didn&#39;t need to be constantly resorting to their own magical efforts to try to contain them, because God already won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This motif of Jesus defeating evil as well as death is a common one throughout the Pauline letters, as well as other texts like Revelation and Jesus&#39; casting out demons in the Gospels. In the Adult Ed today, we&#39;ll look a bit at some other motifs in the New Testament for explaining exactly what was accomplished by Jesus&#39; life, death, and resurrection. This is the most prominent one: that somehow Jesus defeated evil and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&#39;t completely dropped social media this year for Lent as I often have in the past, but I have tried to maintain stricter limits. I&#39;m trying to find that balance of staying informed without being overwhelmed. That does mean that some days with how fast the news is changing that I miss about 6 stages of commentary on new tariffs, then counter tariffs, then a reversal of part of a tariff, then a delay of one tariff but another one added, then a reversal of part of the reversal from earlier in the day, and I&#39;m very tired of the word tariff even with less social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the ways that I do feel overwhelmed when I spend too much time on social media soaking up every bit of bad news is that I want to know what I can do to defeat these evils. I want to jump to fixing the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That gets me closer to the Ephesians&#39; magical approach. They were trying to constrain evil through their own efforts, as I am often tempted to do. The message that they needed to hear was one of transcendent hope and grace. They were told to be confident in God&#39;s victory. It might not always look like it, but the victory is assured. It wasn&#39;t solely their job to defeat evil through sheer effort, with the right magical words or actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself thinking that this is the main message I needed to hear from the letter, too: I, alone, raging against the darkness, cannot fix everything. Fortunately, I am not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This God does not sit back and wish us good luck defeating evil. This God has led the charge into the darkness. This God is one who entered the trenches, who has defeated evil and is defeating evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-gods-armour&quot;&gt;How: God&#39;s Armour&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This passage is often referred to as the &amp;quot;armour of God&amp;quot; and that leaves upon a couple of possibilities for how to interpret the preposition &amp;quot;of.&amp;quot; Tom Yoder Neufeld unpacks this well in his commentary. He argues that it is a mistake to believe that it is God giving us necessary protection for our battles, like God is just the blacksmith. Instead, this is God&#39;s armour, the mechanisms by which God fights. This text, first and foremost, is saying what God is like and has done, summarizing a letter which has largely been about what God has done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it was interesting in Marcus&#39; message a few weeks ago when he mentioned how Paul and those others who wrote in his name get cast as legalistic. I&#39;ve heard that version, that Paul is all about the harsh rules that we must follow. Therefore, they conclude, we need to dismiss him and everything he wrote. I&#39;ve also heard the version that Paul is obsessed with a cheap empty version of grace, that God has already forgiven us no matter what we&#39;ve done to hurt each other, so don&#39;t worry about things like social injustices that we are participating in. Therefore, Paul does not adequately prepare us to be capable of things like apologizing or learning to love people better. In conclusion, we should dismiss him and everything that he wrote. We&#39;ve got one big chunk of people upset at Paul for one idea and another big chunk upset at Paul for the complete opposite idea.
I think those two extremes are missing that there is a third option. According to this text, the battle is fought by &amp;quot;putting on&amp;quot; this new reality, this new way of being that was revealed most fully in Jesus. We are invited to inhabit the way of God, participating in God&#39;s battle with God&#39;s armour. This aligns with much of the other language of Ephesians to this point, about being the new creation in Christ. We don&#39;t fight our own battle through our own magical efforts, essentially the legalistic reading of Paul. We don&#39;t sit back and pretend there isn&#39;t a battle either, which is essentially the cheap grace reading of Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each piece of armour, what God&#39;s new way of being looks like, could be its own sermon. These are big ideas: truth, peace, justice, and the word of God. We don&#39;t have time for that. Believe me, I was ready to give a rant on the concept of truth in the disinformation social media age. You&#39;ve been spared from that with the time limits on these sermons, which I am pushing close to, so it is time to wrap up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main takeaway is that the church is called to a way of being that follows God&#39;s lead and stands in contrast to the powers. Where the powers use misinformation and disinformation to amass wealth and influence, God is truthful and calls the church to be truthful. Where the powers seek to divide and incite violence, God reconciles humanity and calls the church to be peacemakers. Where the world accepts injustice if it benefits them, God seeks justice for the most marginalized, even at cost to themself on the cross, and calls the church to do the same. This is who God is, that is how God defeats evil, and that is what we are invited to put on as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;resources&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;books&quot;&gt;Books&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florer-Bixler, M. (2021). &lt;em&gt;How to have an enemy : righteous anger and the work of peace&lt;/em&gt;. Herald Press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have referenced this book multiple times before. It is very good at acknowledging that we do have enemies in the sense that we do have those who are actively opposing what we would consider to be the just way of being in the world, and then looking at how we deal with them in a Jesus-like way. Like I tried to do, it doesn&#39;t accept either extreme framing that there is no battle or that our battle is about dominating others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Du Mez, K. K. (2021). &lt;em&gt;Jesus and John Wayne : how white evangelicals corrupted a faith and fractured a nation&lt;/em&gt;. Liveright Publishing Corporation, a division of W.W. Norton &amp;amp; Company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a historical book that traces the development of the macho violent Christian masculinity imagery over the past century, more relevant to some discussion of the call to fight version of Christianity that I largely cut out from the sermon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arnold, C. E. (1989). &lt;em&gt;Ephesians, power and magic : the concept of power in Ephesians in light of its historical setting&lt;/em&gt;. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the most academic commentary that I went through. It is largely focused on what the &amp;quot;powers and principalities&amp;quot; were in the Ephesians context – how they likely understood these spiritual forces as well as gods like Ephesian Artemis – and what &amp;quot;Paul&amp;quot; was saying about Jesus&#39; victory over them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neufeld, T. Y. (2002). &lt;em&gt;Ephesians&lt;/em&gt;. Herald Press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Yoder Neufeld&#39;s commentary also covers the whole letter, but from an explicitly Anabaptist perspective. There were a couple of key points that came up in his discussion of the &amp;quot;God&#39;s Armour&amp;quot; section which I used in the sermon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;videos&quot;&gt;Videos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more on Artemis of Ephesus, here&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9IF4vE9UGE&quot;&gt;a good video from Religion for Breakfast&lt;/a&gt;. That doesn&#39;t impact much about how we read Ephesians, but it is interesting as part of the setting where her worship was quite possibly part of what was meant within &amp;quot;powers and principalities&amp;quot; (the Clinton Arnold book cited above also discussed her place in Ephesian religion).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lectionary Notes: Mar 2, 2025</title>
    <link href="https://theology.ryanrobinson.ca/2025/lectionary-mar2/" />
    <updated>2025-03-01T11:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://theology.ryanrobinson.ca/2025/lectionary-mar2/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been invited to join a group spanning a few churches to share reactions to the lectionary text for the week. Here are my notes going into our final week, Transfiguration Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-texts&quot;&gt;The Texts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=384&amp;amp;z=e&amp;amp;d=23&quot;&gt;Here are the texts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one felt more like the same themes throughout all of them, rather than a progression from one text to the next, so I&#39;m going to structure my notes that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mountains&quot;&gt;Mountains&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting that the encounters with God happen on a mountain each time. It wasn&#39;t unusual in the ancient world to see mountains as liminal spaces, where the gods could more easily meet with humans. Mountains also had practical advantages as the best places to build a city: easier to defend from attackers, easier to have waste water flow downhill away from drinking supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we could argue there&#39;s still some sense that &amp;quot;mountains as liminal space&amp;quot; is true because being on a mountain evokes awe at creation which can make you feel closer to God, but I&#39;m not going to read too much more into it than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;shining&quot;&gt;Shining&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the idea of faces literally shining after encountering God. Jesus is shining in the Transfiguration. Moses shines without even realizing it after talking with God and receiving the commands. Corinthians doesn&#39;t reference shining but does promise transformation in other ways: real freedom, not losing heart, sticking to the truth and conscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;veils&quot;&gt;Veils&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Moses&#39; face shone so much that he had to put a veil over his face. He had to be an intermediary between the Israelites and God because the glory of God was scary to the Israelites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corinthians uses the veil language a slightly different way. After referencing how Moses needed a veil to keep people from looking directly at God&#39;s glory, he claims that whenever Moses is read, there is still a veil over their minds. In contrast, when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed and now we see the glory of the Lord as if through a mirror, a perfect reflection. By seeing that perfect image of God, we also become more transformed into that image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The veiled message through Moses wasn&#39;t wrong. But it was a little bit blurry, veiled for a people who weren&#39;t quite ready for it. Now in Jesus we can see more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some potential for antisemitism in the veil idea, if we equate &amp;quot;in Jesus we think we see God more clearly&amp;quot; as &amp;quot;Jewish people are inferior.&amp;quot; There isn&#39;t a logical reason why the former would lead to the latter, but it is pretty common in our culture to take a lot of our sense of worth from being right about something, especially the big worldview-shaping things like religious belief. We can simply and humbly acknowledge that the Christian tradition thinks Jesus is the clear revelation of God. It&#39;s fine that Jews and Muslims and Hindus and Buddhists and everyone else disagrees. That doesn&#39;t make us superior to them. There&#39;s no reason why difference has to mean hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;continuity&quot;&gt;Continuity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the essential counter in these texts to some of the antisemitism risk is that Jesus is within a long line of Jews who encountered God. We get the Moses story, shining so brightly that others couldn&#39;t look at him. The psalm references Moses, Aaron, and Samuel. Corinthians mentions Moses. And Luke mentions Moses and Elijah. There is a sense that Jesus is the fullest revelation of God, but that is firmly coming within the continuity of the Jewish tradition, not discarding that tradition at all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lectionary Notes: Feb 23, 2025</title>
    <link href="https://theology.ryanrobinson.ca/2025/lectionary-feb23/" />
    <updated>2025-02-23T13:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://theology.ryanrobinson.ca/2025/lectionary-feb23/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve joined a group spanning a few churches to share reactions to the lectionary text for the week. Here are my notes going into February 23, 2025, the seventh Sunday after Epiphany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-texts&quot;&gt;The Texts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=384&amp;amp;z=e&amp;amp;d=20&quot;&gt;Here are the texts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;genesis-45-3-11-15&quot;&gt;Genesis 45:3-11, 15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This picks up at the (mostly) happy ending of the story. At this point, Joseph reveals himself to his brothers, says something that sounds like forgiveness of what they did to him selling him as a slave into Egypt, and declares how even though they meant harm God worked it out for the good of everyone. He promises to provide for them during the famine and kisses them and wept. That&#39;s a pretty powerful story of reunion, reconciliation, and God working even through evil to bring about a good outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you read the few chapters before this, starting at chapter 42, Joseph did a lot of torturing his brothers before this big moment of forgiveness. Most of the brothers, all but Benjamin, first come to Egypt to buy food because there&#39;s a famine and only Egypt stockpiled enough food (thanks to Joseph&#39;s interpretation of dreams). They meet Joseph but don&#39;t recognize him, having assumed he died a long time ago or at least was still a slave. He recognizes them, accuses them of being spies, and says that the rest of them will stay in prison until one of them goes back and gets Benjamin, which somehow will prove that they&#39;re not spies. He put them all in prison for 3 days, then softens the offer to only making Simeon stay. Then he puts the silver which the brothers had used to buy the food back into their sacks so that they will panic when they see it, knowing that they will be accused of theft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brothers (other than Simeon) get back to Jacob and tell them they need to take Benjamin this time. They get back to Egypt with everything they have to offer, including a lot more silver, and immediately explain how they got their silver back on the previous trip. Joseph says that&#39;s fine, serves them a giant dinner, and then does the same thing again: sends them on their way but with their silver returned quietly to their bags. That sounds generous. But this time instead of letting them go, he immediately sends somebody to catch them, accuse them of theft, and threaten to make whoever is found to have the silver a slave. That is Benjamin, Jacob&#39;s favourite. Judah knows that this would kill his father Jacob to lose Benjamin and offers to stay instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s when we get to this passage and its happy ending. With the time to travel back and forth between Egypt and Canaan, this would have been months of emotional torture of his brothers and father, and keeping one in prison. There is no apology for any of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the big theme here that lines up with other recent weeks and other texts this week: God reverses our power structures. The older brothers meant to harm him, but God took care of him and ultimately put him in a position of power over his brothers where they depended on him. That part is powerful and reassuring in a world where we often feel like we don&#39;t see justice. But in this particular story, there is a lot of cruelty along the way, and on its own it might be too easy to fall into concepts of justice that require extensive punishment before forgiveness is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;psalm-37-1-11-39-40&quot;&gt;Psalm 37:1-11, 39-40&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It largely has the same themes of the reversal of power, but explicitly without a lot of the retribution first. This is clear that you should not fret because of the wicket, refrain from anger, forsake wrath. In short, we don&#39;t need to seek retribution because God will make sure things are set right. God is our salvation and refuge, not needing to take revenge into our own hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-corinthians-15-35-38-42-50&quot;&gt;1 Corinthians 15:35-38, 42,50&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This flows fairly well out of the above theme of the psalm. We trust that God will make things right, not following the logic of the world that demands we take vengeance ourselves. This is supported by the resurrection, where God in Jesus allowed himself to be killed but then came back. This shows that God has power over death and those who seek to wield death. The power reversal happens, but it comes through death which at first seems like it is supporting the existing power. &amp;quot;What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;luke-6-27-38&quot;&gt;Luke 6:27-38&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Luke text perhaps makes these themes a bit more practical. While the psalm and Corinthians declare that God will bring salvation from the wicked powers of the world, Luke gets more down-to-earth in what this looks like when you are oppressed by those wicked powers. Rather than only loving those who love you, Jesus commands that we are to also love our enemies, which in that context would have included some brutal Roman oppressors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there is an interesting three steps of hatred toward you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do good to those who hate you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bless those who curse you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pray for those who mistreat you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, if somebody hates you but isn&#39;t directly harming you, you have some potential to actively do good to them, which will maybe cutting them off from hating you. If it escalates to them actively cursing you, you can actively bless them in return. If they are actively harming you, you probably aren&#39;t in a position anymore to actively seek practical good for them, but you can still pray for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;turn the other cheek&amp;quot; part is often misinterpreted as encouraging passivity, however. This isn&#39;t accurate. The Matthew version of this text, in 5:38-40, is a bit more clear, as it specifies that if someone slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek as well. What&#39;s the difference? Try to imagine if somebody is looking at you and they&#39;re right-handed as everyone was assumed to be. For them to slap you on your right cheek, they need to backhand you. This part is still mostly true today: a backhand slap is usually a sign of dominating power over someone who think is clearly inferior to you. You don&#39;t backhand someone who is your equal. So when you turn the other cheek, you&#39;re essentially saying &amp;quot;you may have the power to slap me but I&#39;m going to make you look me in the eye and treat me as an equal while you do it.&amp;quot; And that sounds a lot like nonviolent resistance movements in the modern world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an interesting progression in the order of these texts, which doesn&#39;t always work out that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Genesis, we see God working for the good despite evil situations, reversing power structures to put the little brother sold into slavery back in a position over his brothers. But he still clearly felt he had to do some major revenge first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Psalm encourages us to let go of our anger and trust that God will take care of that power reversal without us needing to take revenge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Corinthians, we see how that parallels the logic of death and resurrection, requiring that we die to self in order to be raised again in God&#39;s new life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Luke, Jesus explicitly teaches us to do some of that dying to self by loving those enemies even while they are oppressing us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    <title>Religious Legacy in Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</title>
    <link href="https://theology.ryanrobinson.ca/2025/kingdom-planet-apes/" />
    <updated>2025-02-19T16:46:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://theology.ryanrobinson.ca/2025/kingdom-planet-apes/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite movies of 2024 was &lt;em&gt;Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes&lt;/em&gt;, despite it getting mostly just ok reviews. I watched it again recently after picking up the 4K Blu-ray. I love how it handles legacy and the conflict between maintaining a message of peace and those who want to use that brand while furthering the opposite of peace, violent empire building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;encountering-a-compassionate-caesar&quot;&gt;Encountering a Compassionate Caesar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some background, in the previous 3 movies, Caesar was the leader of the apes. He wasn&#39;t perfect, but mostly he managed to unite apes to work together and to not start any fights with humans. Over the course of that trilogy, the power dynamic flipped from humans being dominant and apes just trying to survive to a more equal war and eventually to humans fighting for their survival, but Caesar remained true to his convictions of trying to find a peaceful coexistence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kingdom&lt;/em&gt; jumps ahead several generations. Our new main character Noa hasn&#39;t even heard of Caesar at first, coming of age happily in his peaceful ape community living harmoniously in nature. But then his community is attacked and taken away and he must set out to save them. During the attack is the first and second time we hear &amp;quot;For Caesar&amp;quot; as a clear battle cry of the attacking apes. They clearly see what they are doing as part of the legacy of Caesar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then meets Raka, who is very much styled after a priest, with a stole and a pendant with a religious-like symbol on it. Raka explains that his work has been to protect the real legacy of Caesar. He declares that the attackers are shameful to misuse Caesar&#39;s name and how it is sad that so few remember the true Caesar, with him as the last member of the Order of Caesar. He repeats &amp;quot;Apes together strong&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ape shall not kill ape,&amp;quot; a couple of Caesar&#39;s main recurring phrases. He explains that humans are slow witted but there was a time when humans and apes lived side by side, during the time of Caesar, and they were important to Caesar, so he will do his best to be compassionate to them as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They see a human (played by Freya Allen) near Noa&#39;s horse and Noa tries to scare her away, but Raka says that she is not a threat. Raka then decides to join Noa on his journey because the human is following Noa, which intrigues Raka. Raka is kind to the human, sharing food and warmth while encouraging mercy. He names her Nova, the name for all humans, although he doesn&#39;t know why, just that it has been that way since Caesar&#39;s time (that happened in the previous movie, &lt;em&gt;War&lt;/em&gt;). He explains how Caesar cared so much for humans, leading with decency, morality, compassion. Noa is skeptical but plays along, then starts to realize that she is smart and develops some compassion for her because she reacts to looking through a telescope the same way he does. They decide to share a horse so she can come with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They encounter a &amp;quot;herd&amp;quot; of other humans, who don&#39;t have the intelligence of Nova, but they are then attacked by the same mysterious group who attacked Noa&#39;s community earlier. Noa saves Nova, but in the process Nova reveals that she can speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few scenes of bonding later, Raka sacrifices himself to save Nova whose real name we have now learned is Mae, and as he is about to die he says &amp;quot;together strong.&amp;quot; Not &amp;quot;ape together strong,&amp;quot; just &amp;quot;together strong.&amp;quot; He is modifying Caesars words but to maintain Caesars teaching about compassion for humans. That is a fascinating insight into healthy religion: cling to the love message that matters and be a little loose with specific phrases. Some branches of religious traditions get that backwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;proximus-and-empire&quot;&gt;Proximus and Empire&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noa and Mae are captured by the violent group of apes and we start to see how their interpretation of Caesar is extremely different. They are assembling an Empire. Proximus, their leader, gets a lot of his inspiration learning about Ancient Roman history. They interpret &amp;quot;apes together strong&amp;quot; in a much more fascist way: that they must force all apes to work together over and against humans. It&#39;s not about strength in diverse unity. It&#39;s about strength through dominant uniformity with one clear ape in charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part also has &lt;a href=&quot;https://theology.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2021/many-tongues/&quot;&gt;some major Tower of Babel vibes&lt;/a&gt;. Apes from all kinds of diverse communities are forced to work together against their will to further the power of their new Caesar, Proximus, just as the slaves building Babel were forced to work for that empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way this oppressive oppressive kingdom is ultimately broken down is also like the Babel story: they embrace their diverse roots; they do not accept that they are only ape slaves to Proximus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proximus talks about the need for evolution, to become even stronger, more dominant over others. He refers to &amp;quot;my kingdom&amp;quot; which is the kind of sense of ownership over other apes that Caesar never showed. The contrast couldn&#39;t get much stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-christian-allegory&quot;&gt;The Christian Allegory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all seemed like a pretty obvious allegory of Christianity, or for that matter, pretty much any religion or tradition that has ever had the opportunity to hold power over others. There will be some who declare that their religion requires them to dominate others, to enforce uniformity, to put themselves in charge for the good of everyone. Even if all of that explicitly goes against the teachings of their founder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are also those like Raka, those who are determined to maintain the peaceful vision of their founder, who encourage compassion toward those who are different and celebrates diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a choice which mode of maintaining our tradition we advance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lectionary Notes: Feb 16, 2025</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve joined a group spanning a few churches to share reactions to the lectionary text for the week. Here are my notes going into February 16, 2025, the sixth Sunday after Epiphany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-texts&quot;&gt;The Texts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=384&amp;amp;z=e&amp;amp;d=19&quot;&gt;Here are the texts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not going to do each text separately as I have the past few weeks, because there isn&#39;t a lot unique between them jumping out at me. There are a couple major themes, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;trust-and-wealth&quot;&gt;Trust and Wealth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A theme in all four texts is to trust in God, not in the ways of the wicked. The Luke text at least partially equates &amp;quot;the wicked&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;the rich.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They each tackle that we have some drive, maybe naturally and/or maybe fueled by the advice of those wicked systems and individuals, trying to convince us that we will be satisfied if we pursue wealth for ourselves. We just need to climb to the top of the social hierarchy and then everything will be fine. Not for the people we have to climb over, of course, but let&#39;s not think about them - let&#39;s focus on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Jeremiah says that this leads to being like a shrub in the desert, not seeing relief, unlike those who trust in the LORD who will continue to bear fruit and not be anxious. Psalm 1 emphasizes that the wicked will be driven away by the wind, while again those who delight in God will yield fruit and not wither. Those are very similar metaphors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians starts to tie this into the resurrection. If that hope of trusting in God is only in life, it is futile. It is obvious that if we are judging only by short-term material wealth and social power, the way of Jesus is pretty naive and ineffective. But if we believe that there is a longer arc of history than that, that there is resurrection, the hope is valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke most explicitly ties this into wealth, sending woe on the rich and blessings on the poor. Matthew&#39;s version of this in the Sermon on the Mount is a bit more abstracted, about the &amp;quot;poor in spirit&amp;quot; without the accompanying woe on the rich, but Luke is more direct to the point. If you prioritize wealth and people speaking well of you, you might get it in the short term, but that&#39;s the entire reward. It&#39;s an Ebenezer Scrooge situation, where you get your wealth for now but you are miserable and have no meaning beyond that. &amp;quot;You have received your consolation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hope-for-justice&quot;&gt;Hope for Justice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another related theme that is present here is that 3 out of the 4 texts (not really the Corinthians one) clearly displays some desire to see negative consequences for those who are doing evil. This is often not a popular position among more privileged &amp;quot;liberal&amp;quot; communities who often want to get rid of any language like that entirely, since it sounds too close to the vindictive god held by more conservative communities who are also often privileged in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don&#39;t think justice and vindictive punishment need to be the same thing. When you have been truly mistreated, especially on a systemic level, it is absolutely normal and in my opinion correct to wish to see consequences - the &amp;quot;woe&amp;quot; that Jesus promises - on those who are hurting you. That doesn&#39;t need to be violent gleeful punishment, but we should be able to acknowledge that something is wrong with this picture and something needs to be done to change it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To bring in the Corinthians a bit less directly, what if God&#39;s justice looks like the death and resurrection of Jesus. It was not justice that killed Jesus. It was profoundly unjust, with those in power deciding to shut down somebody who challenged their power, even though he had not done anything provably illegal to justify a death penalty even by the laws of the time. And yet, if we believe Jesus was the incarnate God who chose that willingly and then was brought back to life? That changes how we think about justice. It isn&#39;t about hurting for the sake of hurting the Romans who killed Jesus, but it does expose and overcome the injustice they committed. God&#39;s power is greater than that injustice and greater than death, which is often the implicit or explicit threat of those carrying out the injustice. If those acting unjustly no longer have the power of death to threaten you, they have no real power over you at all. Real justice requires exposing their injustice. At best, maybe they learn from the consequences of their injustice being exposed and they repent (turn around to a more just way of being).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the difference between retributive justice, seeking to punish for the sake of punishing, and restorative justice, seeking to make the world whole again (including the oppressors if they will accept it). Being critical of retributive justice is great, but don&#39;t replace that with &amp;quot;well I guess there is no justice.&amp;quot; Instead, try to imagine a restored world, where the oppression is stopped and hopefully the oppressor learns after experiencing those negative consequences to not try it again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lectionary Notes: Feb 9, 2025</title>

    <updated>2025-02-08T11:00:00Z</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve joined a group spanning a few churches to share reactions to the lectionary text for the week. Here are my notes going into February 9, 2025, the fifth Sunday after Epiphany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-texts&quot;&gt;The Texts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?z=e&amp;amp;d=18&amp;amp;y=384&quot;&gt;Here are the texts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;isaiah-6-1-13&quot;&gt;Isaiah 6:1-13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second week in a row, we get a prophetic call story. This time it is Isaiah and it is more poetic, but the key points are the same: God is holy, the prophet is unworthy, God offers some kind of healing or purification that convinces the prophet to proclaim coming destruction. Even though Isaiah, unlike Jeremiah, is mostly seen as a very hopeful text, that isn&#39;t as obvious in this call narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;psalm-138&quot;&gt;Psalm 138&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also similar to last week&#39;s Psalm in some of its themes: God is mighty but has special care for those judged to be lowly in human culture, protecting them from their enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-corinthians-15-1-11&quot;&gt;1 Corinthians 15:1-11&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Christ died for our sins&amp;quot; definitely has some potential to go down the atonement theory rabbit. Those who believe in penal substitutionary atonement may see this as a prooftext, but it doesn&#39;t actually anything about God&#39;s wrath or justice needing to be satisfied. Even the &amp;quot;for our sins&amp;quot; may be a questionable preposition translation, if I am remembering correctly. I don&#39;t have a good source for that handy, but I believe that is just as easily translated to &amp;quot;because of our sins&amp;quot; which is a simpler cause and effect, not necessarily implying that our sins were placed on Jesus as a scapegoat in order to absorb our penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other prooftext rabbit hole it is easy to go down here is apologetics. It cites more than five hundred who witnessed the risen Jesus. That&#39;s not really an airtight apologetics argument since it&#39;s not like we have any way of verifying that those five hundred people really did encounter the risen Jesus and told everyone about it. But that&#39;s not really a focus in this text either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More to the point of this text is in line with the prophetic call narratives of these past two weeks and the psalms of the past two weeks. Paul is emphasizing that he is not that significant, the last to see the risen Christ, the least of the apostles, unfit to be called an apostle, etc. But because of God&#39;s grace toward those who are not worthy, he now is preaching that grace to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;luke-5-1-11&quot;&gt;Luke 5:1-11&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of those Jesus stories that seem a little silly at first. They&#39;ve been fishing all night, not catching much, and Jesus comes along and tells them to put their nets a few feet away on the other side of the boat. Seriously, why would moving the net that small distance go from catching nothing to being completely full immediately, enough that the boat starts to sink. And that&#39;s how Simon (Peter), James and John were recruited to become disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It carries some of the themes from the other texts: they aren&#39;t particularly worthy. They can&#39;t even catch fish on their own, which is their whole job. Simon Peter declares that he is too sinful to be worthy of joining Jesus. Jesus reassures them to not be afraid and to join him despite their &amp;quot;unworthiness.&amp;quot; Then they left everything - all those fish that they had just worked all day trying to catch - in order to take Jesus up on his offer.&lt;/p&gt;
